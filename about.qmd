My name is Shannon Quinn. I'm an associate professor in the [School of Computer Science](https://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~squinn/) and [Department of Cellular Biology](https://cellbio.uga.edu/directory/people/shannon-quinn) at the University of Georgia. Which is ironic at some level, considering my undergraduate degree in Computer Science came from Georgia Tech ([GO JACKETS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygxDs_zcayo)).

My interests are pretty broad, but the best summary I can give is that I enjoy hacking at large-scale data science problems. Recently I've been getting into DevOps, and ways of operationalizing machine learning; reproducibility is very important to me, and anything that helps make the hidden work of preprocessing, pretraining, and even precoding explicit is a good idea in my book. Perhaps unsurprisingly, I'm a huge proponent of open source development, and a big believer in open science. I try to make tools, data, and course materials all available with open source licenses, and try to give back to the open source communities whenever and however I can.

In my copious (lulz) free time, I enjoy board gaming, video gaming, and anything that involves working up a sweat: baseball, football, basketball, racquetball, cycling, hiking, and [especially running](https://wherearethepancakes.wordpress.com/).
