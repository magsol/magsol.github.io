Happy 2018!

I've been wanting to put a fresh coat of paint on things for awhile around here,
especially since the old Flex template didn't have a really good way of supporting
embedded Jupyter notebooks without completely upending the CSS (love the theme
otherwise!).

Taking a page (or really, an entire layout) from [Jake's blog](https://jakevdp.github.io/),
I can now embed Jupyter notebooks without trashing the whole layout of the site.
There are some posts I've been wanting to make for awhile that will require a
considerable amount of code, so I'm excited to be able to dig into them now!

I'll be following up soon with a lengthier resolutions post, but for now I just
wanted to say "I'm still alive" and roll out the new layout. Happy new year everyone!
