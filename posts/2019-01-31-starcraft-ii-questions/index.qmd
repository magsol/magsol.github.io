I've been sick the past couple of days. In between drinking way too much tea,
passing out cold, and actually getting the occasional bit of work done, I've been
(re-)playing a decent amount of _StarCraft II_, specifically the _Legacy of the Void_
(_LotV_) campaign. It's the final installment of SC2, and honestly it's the one
I find most frustrating.

No, it's not the dialogue, which is _super_ cliche and overwrought, but it's
endemic across the entire SC2 series. Also, the _LotV_ gameplay honestly makes
up for it (as is true for most of the SC2 series).

Rather, my problem is with the actual storytelling. There are lots of
sprawling story elements but a lot of them just don't make
any sense. _Heart of the Swarm_ (_HotS_)
[had a few chin-scratching moments](https://magsol.wordpress.com/2013/04/01/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm-review/),
but overall the storyline was a pretty clear and well-motivated revenge tale.
Even before that, _Wings of Liberty_ (_WoL_) was a clear and compact story of
regret and redemption. So while the _LotV_ gameplay was outstanding, it was
extremely jarring for the story to be so jumbled and reliant on retconning a
large amount of StarCraft lore.

So may I present, [inspired by RedLetterMedia's treatment of _Prometheus_
several years back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1YuvUQFJ0), a list
of questions that came to mind. Presented in no particular order:

![](like_farmville.jpg){fig-alt="A meme image based on a screenshot from in-game Starcraft, with text reading 'Like Farmville, but with attack function.'"}

  - So apparently Emil Narud / Samir Duran was _also_ a fallen Xel'Naga, as he said as much
  in the _LotV_ epilogue missions. Why was he alive all this time, but not Amon?
  How did he escape Amon's fate?
  - Why did he take the form of a human instead of some all-powerful hybrid like the
  ones he was cultivating in those years? What was stopping Amon from taking the form
  of a human as well?
  - What were the purposes of Duran's machinations in _Brood War_? As stated at the time,
 it was in the service of returning Amon and breeding the hybrid, but if he was
 a full Xel'Naga, why would Amon's resurrection even be necessary? Couldn't Narud
 just remake all life in the universe, then resurrect Amon at his leisure for
 their [post-universe-destruction celebration party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_End_(film))?

![](siege_tank_rush.gif){fig-alt="A meme image of the original Starcraft with a screen filled with siege tanks, and text saying 'Where is your god now?'"}

  - Oh man, the [Khala](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Khala). Supposedly the thing
that both saved the Protoss race back in the day, but also nearly led to their
destruction when Amon infiltrated it in _LotV_. A nice symmetry, sure, but... ok.
So. The Khala was linked through khaydarin crystals, which are rife throughout
 Protoss technology. The Protoss themselves interface with it through their
 nerve cords, which [SPOILER ALERT] they all sever at the end of _LotV_ to
 drive Amon back into the Void. But couldn't he just live on in their
 technology?
 - Would the Protoss have to derive entirely new, non-khaydarin crystal
 technology to completely drive out Amon?
 - How on Kerrigan's red Char did they manage to sever the nerve cords of
 literally all the Protoss of the Golden Armada--including those who had not
 yet arrived at Aiur--in the two minutes that the keystone was able to contain
 Amon?! [Rohana](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Rohana) proved that physical
 distance was not an issue for Amon, only connection to the Khala via nerve cords
 did. How could they have possibly gotten the order out to all those Protoss
 in such a short period?
 - Amon is shown leaving Artanis' body when Zeratul severs his nerve cords. But
 couldn't Amon just possess Artanis? Why was Amon able to inhabit the Khala,
 but not individuals?
 - I mean, where is the Khala even centralized? If it's just the psychic
 connection between Protoss--and therefore completely decentralized--wouldn't
 Amon act more like a virus? Why would severing everyone's nerve cords suddenly
 leave Amon homeless? Is severing your nerve cords like a vaccination?
 - Why would Amon even need a "host body" if he's able to take over literally
 all the Khalai Protoss?

 ![](nuclear_launch.png){fig-alt="A meme image of a cat, with text saying 'Nuclear launch detected.'"}

 - How did Amon control the Zerg? Through an Overmind? Where was it located? If
 not, did he exert control over every individual Zerg? How? Why couldn't he do
 the same thing through the Protoss? Or hell, even the Terrans?
 - Did he possess the Zerg? Why couldn't he control Kerrigan's Zerg? Or again,
 the Protoss?
 - Where was Amon in the intervening period of _Heart of the Swarm_ when he was
 (presumably) already revived following the conclusion of _Wings of Liberty_, but
 not yet the main villain at beginning of _LotV_?
 [Drinking at a bar somewhere](https://xkcd.com/712/)?
 - The original StarCraft lore seems to be retconned to suggest (in no uncertain
  terms) that any and all tampering in the development of the Zerg and Protoss
  was the fault of Amon and his followers and _not_ part of the original plan
  put in motion by the Xel'Naga. Does that mean the Khala was Amon's
  creation, as well as the Overmind? What was even supposed to happen absent the
  Khala or the Overmind?
 - Why was Amon so much more powerful than Ouros? They're both Xel'Naga; wouldn't
 they be evenly matched?
 - Kerrigan was Xel'Naga for all of an hour before she flat-out blasted Amon out
 of existence. How? Why was she better equipped to deal with Amon in such short
 order, compared to a friendly Xel'Naga trapped in the Void for eons?
 - Sure, maybe the combined might of both Narud and Amon kept Ouros trapped
 in the Void, but Narud was only with his master for all of a campaign and a half;
 plus, it was only _after_ Stukov dealt Narud the killing blow in the epilogue
 that Ouros began the process of giving Kerrigan his essence. Wouldn't the combined
 might of Kerrigan and Ouros be infinitely more powerful than just Amon?
 - If Amon killed all those slumbering Xel'Naga in Ulnar, why wouldn't they also
 just return to the Void, as Amon did at the end of _LotV_?

![](no_patience.jpg){fig-alt="A meme image showing a siege tank operator in Starcraft II, with text saying 'Claims to have no patience for sitting around, chooses siege tank operator as his profession.'"}

 - The Tal'darim are introduced in _WoL_ as a "fanatical" group of Protoss who
 generally do their own thing. In _LotV_, it's revealed that they're actually
 in league with Amon. But in _WoL_, they are _actively_ fighting _against_ the
 retrieval of the artifact pieces--an essential step to assembling the artifact,
 using it to de-infest Kerrigan, and capturing all that power to resurrect Amon.
 This connection becomes even more confusing when considering that it was
 Moebius Corps who literally hired Jim Raynor and
 his Raiders to assemble the artifact pieces.
 - i.e., Moebius Corps was led by Emil Narud, aka Samir Duran, aka
 _the one dude who's been trying for millennia to resurrect Amon_. Why would
 the Tal'darim fight directly against him? Did it take them the countless ages
 between the [Aeon of Strife](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Aeon_of_Strife)
 and _HotS_ to realize they were working for the same guy?
 - Do the Tal'darim still have their nerve cords? Are they connected to the
  Khala?
 - It would seem not, since after Alarak becomes their highlord and turns
  them against Amon, I would think Amon's first course of action would be to
  take control of them, but he doesn't, or can't. But it seems like they _do_
  have nerve cords, given Alarak's huge jagged ponytail thing. So are they
  somehow _not_ connected to the Khala, despite having nerve cords? If that's
  the case, why can't the Daelaam do the same? Is it a _choice_ to connect to
  the Khala? Is it like the Force--something you can train yourself to use,
  but which you can also consciously separate yourself from?
 - Alarak is, like, wicked powerful. _Crazy_ powerful. He breaks through a
  stasis field on the _Spear of Adun_ like it was tissue paper, and blasts open
  an armored door and destroys a warp crystal on Aiur with a _single shot_. Where
  was that ability when he was fighting Malash for highlord?

![](7_marines.jpg){fig-alt="A meme image showing a Terran Marine, with text reading 'Build 7 marines, lose to 2 zealots.'"}

 - The [Nerazim](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Nerazim) are said to draw
 their power "from the [Void](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Void)". What
 even is the Void? Some kind of [parallel evil dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_Universe)?
 - But the Void clearly has toxic and destabilizing effects on the "current"
 dimension, since anytime a rift opens it pretty much wipes everything it touches
 apart. But then, in the epilogue, everyone gears up and heads into the Void! How?!
 - So, the Dark Templar get their power from the same place as the Xel'Naga? And
 Amon? Wouldn't that mean only a Dark Templar can defeat Amon? Or that Amon
 could pierce Nerazim cloaks?
 - Or, wouldn't that mean Amon would have total control over their abilities,
 making them just as vulnerable to his influence as the Khalai Protoss?
 - Seriously, how are _missiles_ going to be an effective weapon in the Void?
 - Against Narud and Amon?
 - _AMON_.

![](i_got_this.jpeg){fig-alt="A meme image showing a lone Terran Marine standing in front of an Ultralisk, with text reading 'GTFO, I got this.'"}

 - Let's talk a bit about Amon's "plan". He wanted to break the
 [Infinite Cycle](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_Cycle)
 and remake all life in his image. But the end credits of _LotV_ literally
 said, that with Kerrigan's ascension and the alliance's victory over Amon,
 the Infinite Cycles came to an end. So... mission accomplished?
 - So, from the Void, he uses his pawn / follower / fellow Xel'Naga (???) Narud to
 work on a way to resurrect him, creating "false" hybrid armies in the meantime.
 Were these hybrid basically accelerated versions of what the Infinite Cycles
 were supposed to "naturally" result in? I mean, weren't the Zerg and Protoss
 ultimately meant to merge?
 - Amon corrupted the Zerg, creating an overriding imperative to destroy or
 assimilate the Protoss. Since the Protoss can't be infested, I would assume that
 basically amounts to a "kill" order?
 - Anyway, the Overmind cleverly tries to circumvent that order by creating the
 Queen of Blades, with supposedly only slightly more free will than it. Why?
 Where does that slightly-more-free-will come from? Just because she's Terran,
 and therefore not a Xel'Naga creation? Or was it something unique to Kerrigan?
 - Of course, she was only infested _after_ Amon's death. How was Narud/Duran
 planning to resurrect his master, then? It was only the _de_-infestation of
 Kerrigan that gave him enough power to resurrect Amon. So until that unlikely
 sequence of infestation-deinfestation events happened, had he just been spending
 a lot of time on his Pelaton and researching
 [cutting-edge battery technology](https://www.tesla.com/powerwall)?

 Really, I just think [this game sucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX_FxBSEh1A).

 (not really tho)
