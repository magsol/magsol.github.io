<p>As I write this up, I’m sitting in my SciPy hotel room. It’s a nice way to relax and unwind after a <em>long</em> day of travel and tutorials, but I also apologize for any timezone weirdness or general grammar or syntax errors.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the seven months since <a href="../../posts/2023-02-28-mastodon-conclusions/index.html">standing up my own Mastodon instance</a>, the Mastodon team has made quite a few releases. Up until last week, I was running <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/tree/v4.0.2">4.0.2</a>, which had originally been released back in November 2022 when I started this crazy journey.</p>
<p>I’d also been wanting to perform a hardware upgrade of the Pi cluster. The server rack I built back in mid-2022, while effective at protecting the cluster from toddlers, was a mess of cables on the inside: turns out, five stacked Raspberry Pi boards have a lot of associated cabling!</p>
<p>My plan for hardware updates included:</p>
<ul>
<li>installing <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/poe-plus-hat/">power-over-ethernet (PoE) hardware-attached-on-top (HAT)s</a> on each Raspberry Pi, so I could supply both power and networking through the ethernet cable</li>
<li>rewiring the 3x Raspberry Pi case fans to be USB-powered, rather than depending on connections to the GPIO boards of each Pi</li>
<li>downsizing the power brick inside the server case</li>
</ul>
<p>This all took quite a bit of work. And, oddly enough, the software was the <em>easy</em> part.</p>
<section id="upgrading-mastodon" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="upgrading-mastodon">Upgrading Mastodon</h3>
<p>This was “merely” a matter of running an upgrade using the latest Helm chart from Mastodon’s repository. There was a minor wrinkle: the chart had been <em>substantially</em> updated from the one I used to install Mastodon back in December 2022. It <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/chart">has its own repository now</a>!</p>
<p>I had to carefully go through the chart I used to originally install Mastodon, and the new chart, to make sure I was correctly transferring old configuration values to the new chart. I really only made two mistakes in this process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I forgot to fill in the mailer configuration</li>
<li>When specifying the tag, I first put “4.1.3”, instead of “v4.1.3” 🤦‍♂️</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, both were easy fixes. What was a bit trickier was the re-emergence of a <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/chart/issues/73">well-known race condition</a> in the database migration process. It took three separate re-starts of the upgrade process, but it eventually ran to successful completion, and my instance is now running 4.1.3!</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hardware-upgrades">Hardware Upgrades</h3>
<p>If the software upgrades took a day, the hardware upgrades took a week.</p>
<p>I mentioned I wanted to install PoE HATs on each Raspberry Pi so they could draw both their power and network connectivity from a single ethernet connection.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="poe_hat.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="A stack of 6 PoE HAT boxes, waiting to be unboxed and installed, one per Raspberry Pi."></p>
<figcaption>How many HATs does one person need?</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>What I didn’t mention is: there’s more to it than that. To power devices using PoE, you also need networking hardware that is PoE-compatible. This meant replacing my standard 6-port unmanaged switch with a PoE-compatible switch.</p>
<p>It also meant upgrading from 6 ports to 8, since I also wanted to add a 6th Pi to the cluster—which, when you include the necessary port for connecting the switch to the <em>rest</em> of the network, means a minimum of 7 ports.</p>
<p><img src="poe_switch.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="A Netgear 8-port unmanaged PoE+ switch. Officially, its product number is GS308P."></p>
<p>To start, I had to shut down and disassemble the Raspberry Pi cluster (which you can see in <a href="../../posts/2023-01-20-mastodon-instance-k3s-rpi-introduction/index.html">this post back in January</a>). Here was the result, along with the 6th Pi I wanted to add:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="rpis.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Six Raspberry Pi boards, all on the desk."></p>
<figcaption>So much pi(e).</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>With the Pi cluster itself out of the homemade rack, you can see the interior with all the rest of the cabling:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="rack_interior.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Interior shot of my homemade server rack, which is really just a wooden crate with some cut-outs for intake/exhaust fans and a clear plexiglass side for viewing. Inside the Raspberry Pi cluster has been removed, leaving the original 6-port switch, power brick, ethernet cables, power cables, and fan cables. So many cables."></p>
<figcaption>Cables cables everywhere but not an ounce of space.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Yeah. It was pretty crowded, even without the little stack of 5 Raspberry Pi boards. Clearing some of that out via PoE sounded really, really good.</p>
<p>The first step was to install the PoE HAT on each Raspberry Pi. Here’s a before shot:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="single_pi.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="A single Raspberry Pi 4B board, unmodified."></p>
<figcaption>A standard Raspberry Pi 4B.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>And here’s what it looks like when I’ve installed a PoE HAT on it:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="pi_hat.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="A single Raspberry Pi 4B board, now with a PoE HAT on it."></p>
<figcaption>A standard Raspberry Pi 4B, now with a PoE HAT on it.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As an aside: this adds a surprising amount of weight to the Pi! By itself it wasn’t all that noticeable, but once I’d re-stacked the Pi cluster, I was more than a little shocked by how much heavier it was! Something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>The server rack I built has three Pi case fans as intake, and previously these were powered by literally hooking them into the 5V GPIO pins of three of the Pi boards. Now that all the Pi boards had HATs on, their GPIO pins were entirely inaccessible. Which was fine, because I’d wanted to convert the intake fans to USB power anyway—I’d done this already for the two exhaust fans, which I had cannibalized from an old desktop RAM cooler.</p>
<p>Fun fact: these old RAM cooler fans were the same size as the Pi case fans, but for some reason were 12V fans (and USB is, by default, 5V), so I needed to leverage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law">Ohm’s Law</a> and buy a converter that upped the resistence in order to increase the voltage.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this was not the case for the Pi case fans: they needed 5V, and 5V is what any standard USB plug provides. All that was needed was some minor rewiring so the fan leads connected to the corresponding wires inside a USB cable. The end result looked something like this:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="rewired_fan.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="A standard 5V Raspberry Pi case fan with its two cables connected to the corresponding power/ground wires inside a USB cable that has been cut open."></p>
<figcaption>Some minor surgery later and we have a USB powered fan!</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I could now plug all five rack fans (three intake, two exhaust) directly into a new and smaller power brick, courtesy of some USB-to-outlet adapters to help further compress the size.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="power_brick.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="A small Anker power brick with three standard outlets on the front, two of which have USB-to-outlet adapters plugged in, and each adapter has two USB ports. With two additional USB ports in the back, there are six USB outlets on the brick to power the five USB fans, and one standard outlet to power the PoE 8-port switch."></p>
<figcaption>There are two more USB outlets in the back of the brick.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>All that was left at this point was to reassemble the Pi cluster. As I said, I was surprised by the sturdiness of six Pi boards with PoE HATs:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="full_cluster.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="The reassembled Pi cluster, with six Raspberry Pi boards stacked up, each with a PoE HAT."></p>
<figcaption>Behold this fully armed and operational Pi cluster.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>It took several days’ worth of spare time to get everything together, but I’m proud to say that when I plugged the power brick into the wall, <em>every</em> single light and fan turned on all at once.</p>
<p>It was beautiful.</p>
<p>And mere minutes after, our Mastodon instance was back up and running, too! No commands or instructions needed on my part. Which is, frankly, impressive: as complex as kubernetes is, and as difficult as it can be to stand up applications in it, it’s remarkably robust once you’ve got it up and running.</p>
</section>
<section id="next-steps" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>
<p>I’ll probably just enjoy this for a bit 😀</p>
<p>But later, I’ll upgrade Mastodon again. On the hardware end, I don’t really have any additional ideas for the moment! Longer term, though, I have plans to move the Pi cluster into an <em>actual</em> homelab server rack (along with our home NAS, a full-sized home server, and all the networking equipment we have currently lying on the floor).</p>
<p>But that’s for another time 👋</p>
