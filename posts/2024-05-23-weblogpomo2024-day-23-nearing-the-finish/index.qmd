We're at day 23 of `#WeblogPoMo2024`, and this is post number 7 for me---one every three-ish days, give or take. And in today's post, I'm here to say: I'm not sure how many more posts there will be. I'm in and out of travel for most of the remaining month, and while there will be plenty of downtime (and, assuming, WiFi access), I'm not expecting joy-writing to be high on the priority list.

Simply put: between jet lag, phoning home, and a really nasty bee sting I picked up that's taking its sweet time healing---not to mention said travel---I don't really see much time for this.

I could be wrong! There might be another post, or two, or even THREE (gasp). Anything is possible! But given the stress of travel, I want to temper the expectations of my most important of readers: me.

So in possible lieu of any further `#WeblogPoMo2024` posts, please enjoy these _Homeworld 3_ screenshots that were actually taken by yours truly.
