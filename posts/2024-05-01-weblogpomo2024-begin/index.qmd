It's been two months (to the day!) since I last posted here. Not a _long_ stretch, relatively speaking, but a respectable one. It's been a busy couple of months to be sure, but if I'm honest I just haven't been making time to write anything down. Not for lack of things to write---I feel like I'm always composing blog posts in my head---but working+parenting+running+sleeping typically seems to be a potent enough combination to push out all but the highest priority items that don't fall in any of those buckets.

Enter `#WeblogPoMo2024`, something I'd never heard of before seeing [Henry post about it on Mastodon](https://social.lol/@hl/112366042124108733).

Seems challenging while also reasonable: no 2000+ daily word count goal, no minimum running mileage to hit. Just a blog post. I may not finish it (I'd really like to finish an Advent of Code one of these years), but it'd be a nice goal to shoot for. I know from the multitude of early faculty writing workshops I've attended that, at least for me, the single most consistent motivator to write is to **write with other people**. The group accountability just _works_ for me. So maybe it'll work here, too!

Join me, won't you? Or just bug me until I hit "post".
