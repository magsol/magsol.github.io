A solid three weeks late on the new year's resolutions, but still a marked improvement over last year.

(...I didn't post resolutions last year...)

I've been involved with a small faculty writing group since mid-December, with
the expressed goal of helping its participants develop and sustain regular
writing habits. Since any new resolution's long-term success is pretty much
exclusively contingent on whether or not a habit is formed, I'm also trying
to eliminate some bad habits (since new habits are easier to form if they,
in effect, [take the place of the bad habits](https://jamesclear.com/three-steps-habit-change)).

So without further adieu (and with a bit of inspiration from
[Dr. Albert](https://punkrockor.com/2018/01/02/punk-rock-ors-new-years-resolutions/)),
here are my 2018 resolutions:

 - Write and/or edit every single day (operationally I'm aiming for at least
30 minutes/day, 5 days/week, and go from there).
 - Blog more frequently. Despite starting this cool pelican blog back in 2015
for the _expressed_ purpose of basically doing what
[Jake VanderPlas](https://jakevdp.github.io/) does on his blog--but with _my_
research--I have yet to really bring that idea to fruition. That changes this year.
 - Make some progress on a few fun side projects!

There are quite a few side projects that have languished over the last several
months (changing this blog's layout was one). I'd love to actually finish one!
