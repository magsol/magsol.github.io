This is the first of two _Tears of the Kingdom_ related blog posts I'll be making. Don't worry---there won't be any story spoilers in either one. But [my wife did just beat the game this past week](https://quinnwitz.house/@magsol/110792987901449157) (my game isn't anywhere near the end), so I did want to put down some spoiler-free thoughts on the topic, as well as more detail surrounding [recent discoveries on hybrid-powered flight](https://quinnwitz.house/@magsol/110776842879244818) I've been posting about on Mastodon.

In the meantime, I just wanted to put in writing something my wife and I hit on very quickly after starting _Tears of the Kingdom_: the many hats Link wears. Sure, he has a Big Bad he needs to put down---the whole "Hero of hyrule/time/twilight/the skies/winds/dreams/etc" thing---but this is about the _side quests_. In games prior to, oh I don't know, 2017, these always included a few non-warrior talents: escorting people places, fetching an item, taking care of animals, and so on.

But _Tears of the Kingdom_ (and to an only slightly lesser extent, _Breath of the Wild_) took this to a whole new level. Just focusing on the main story quest is starting to feel like [only doing the bare minimum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ChQK8j6so8).

Without further adieu, I give you (this list is most likely incomplete, so please feel free to contribute!):
