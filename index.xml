<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2023-05-09-thoughts-ahead-of-totk/totk_poster.jpg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Official Nintendo poster for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom."></p>
<p>For those who aren’t following the <a href="https://quinnwitz.house/@daysuntil">increasingly unhinged ravings of my countdown bot on Mastodon</a>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> is coming out on Friday, May 12.</p>
<p>And for those who’ve only heard in passing–or who have perhaps never heard–of the Zelda video game franchise: its latest installment is coming out this Friday, May 12, and the Zelda community is absolutely <em>giddy</em> with anticipation.</p>
<p>I could wax historical over its 35 years and 20 different games spanning nearly a dozen (more than a dozen?!) different Nintendo consoles; I could swoon over its cultural impact, influencing other genres and changing, perhaps even unknowingly to many people, how game and puzzle creators approach their design; I could go on about the record-shattering success of its predecessor from 2017, <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, and how this is only the second time in the history of the franchise that Nintendo has made a direct sequel to a previous game; and I could blather on <strong>for.ev.er.</strong> on the established Zelda lore and all the branching theories that its rich storytelling has spawned.</p>
<p>But instead of doing any of that, I just want to put forward one small hope for the game: <strong>I really hope that the game opens with a playable Link getting the absolute snot beat out of him by Ganondorf.</strong></p>
<section id="personally-guide-link-to-his-near-demise" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="personally-guide-link-to-his-near-demise">Personally guide Link to his near-demise</h3>
<p>From the trailers, we know the game starts with our eponymous heroes stumbling upon Ganondorf, and something happens where they get separated, Link is grievously injured, and the Master Sword is damaged; <a href="https://youtu.be/uHGShqcAHlQ?t=177">here’s the part of the latest trailer where it happens</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s the relevant screenshot of it happening:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2023-05-09-thoughts-ahead-of-totk/link_injured.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Screen capture from the latest trailer where Ganondorf's malice is damaging the Master Sword and injuring Link."></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">This should literally not be possible.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>It’s horrifying on multiple fronts. We know it happens sometime near the very beginning of the game (setting the stage for the whole thing), and we also know—one small tidbit of Zelda lore—that it <em>should not be in any way possible for the Master Sword to be damaged by evil. It just shouldn’t.</em> So the fact that it <em>is</em>, is truly terrifying on its own.</p>
<p>But here’s where I’m hoping the game takes it up one more notch: I’m hoping that part at the beginning, where the questing heroes find Ganondorf and get their asses kicked, is <strong>fully playable</strong>.</p>
<p>There’s precedent for this, in fact it’s happened in at least a few games I’ve played, going back almost 20 years!</p>
<section id="quake-4-2005" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quake-4-2005">Quake 4 (2005)</h4>
<p>You play the part of a space marine from Earth tasked with helping push back an alien invasion. For most of the first part of the game, you’re working with your unit to sabotage one of the main “conduits” of the alien military that allows them to communicate and coordinate with each other. You’re eventually successful, but right after, a big bad thought killed in Quake 2 suddenly appears—very clearly alive—and you have to fight him.</p>
<p>You lose. You’re guaranteed to lose. But you still have to fight him. Not only that, but you have to stay alive just long enough to see how every strategy you’ve deployed up until this point fails in spectacular fashion. You can’t even dent the guy’s armor.</p>
<p>Of course, what follows is a long cutscene involving a partial assimilation… it’s a neat sequence, but it requires a bit of a, uh, “constitution” for gore.</p>

<section id="jedi-outcast-2003" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="jedi-outcast-2003">Jedi Outcast (2003)</h4>
<p>You play the role of Kyle Katarn, a mercenary-turned-jedi-turned-mercenary-again. In the pre-sequel-trilogy world, he’s actually the guy who stole the Death Star plans and got them to the Rebellion (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars%3A_Dark_Forces"><em>Dark Forces</em></a>). In the next game (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Jedi_Knight:_Dark_Forces_II"><em>Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight</em></a>), Kyle discovers he’s force-sensitive and trains to become a Jedi. In doing so, he brushes so close to the dark side that he instead chooses to cut himself off from the Force entirely.</p>
<p>That’s where 2003’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Jedi_Knight_II:_Jedi_Outcast"><em>Jedi Outcast</em></a> picks up: he’s back to being a mercenary. One of his missions puts him in an Imperial research lab that appears to be trying to infuse objects with Force energy (think Force batteries). At the end of the mission, he runs headfirst into the Dark Jedi masterminding the whole thing, Desann.</p>
<p>Desann promptly takes his partner hostage, and when Kyle threatens him with a blaster, Desann fires up his lightsaber and dares Kyle to take his partner back. That cues up a fully-playable fight.</p>
<p>I mean, Kyle is a tried-and-true mercenary and at this point in the game has a pretty decent arsenal, too. But the fight is an absolute joke. Energy weapons? Desann just deflects with his lightsaber. Projectile weapons? He Force Pushes backwards and away from him. And explosives? He levitates back towards you. I don’t think it’s actually possible to land a single hit, but you still have to try, just so you can see how woefully inadequate you are when you bring a blaster to a fight with a fully-trained Dark Jedi.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="all-i-ask">All I ask</h3>
<p>That’s what I’m hoping for from <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>: a chance to bring everything we stocked up from <em>Breath of the Wild</em> to the opening fight against Ganondorf, and to lose badly in spite of it all, driving home just how much badder this baddie is than the one we faced at the end of the previous game.</p>
<p>It’s hard to oversell just how overpowered Link was by the very end of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> (assuming your play style leans more toward Completionist than Speedrunner, of course); bringing all that might to bear as <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> kicks off and seeing it just break like waves on the surf would be one hell of an opener.</p>
<p>It’d also be a cool bonus if our last completed <em>Breath of the Wild</em> game slotted into a new <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> game so we started with exactly the same equipment, but I’m not married to that one.</p>
</section>
<section id="oh-and" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="oh-and">Oh, and</h3>
<p>Speaking just for myself: <em>Breath of the Wild</em> was a singularly amazing game, reminding me how much I love to explore and create just for the sake of exploring and creating (not just in video games, either). At the end of the day, I truly don’t care if the opening fight is playable or not. If the Nintendo team can bring that same wonder, that same reward for simple curiosity—kicking over that last rock just for the sake of seeing what’s underneath—then I’ll happily sink another [REDACTED] hours into it.</p>
<p>THREE. MORE. DAYS.</p>

<p>Oh by the way, I have a second blog.</p>
<p>Like this one, it fell into disuse over the past few years. And like this one, I’ve been trying to revive it recently. I’d always intended for that blog and this one to be completely non-overlapping in their respective content, but life, as they say, finds a way.</p>
<p>(Me. I’m talking about me, here. Of course the blog isn’t alive, jeez.)</p>
<p>At any rate, you most likely won’t see me advertise that blog here ever again, but just this once, I wanted to point to a post I made detailing my half marathon this past weekend in Savannah, GA, and the three-year history that particular event has.</p>
<p><a href="https://wherearethepancakes.wordpress.com/2023/04/03/three-years-later/">Here’s the link</a>. Enjoy.</p>

<section id="running-mastodon-has-gotten-easier" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="running-mastodon-has-gotten-easier">Running Mastodon has gotten easier</h3>
<p>In the time I spent planning and writing this blog post series, many of the issues and bugs I ran into already have official fixes (I’ve tried to note PRs, whether merged or still open, where relevant throughout the series). The biggest news of note came down just late last week: <a href="https://blog.bitnami.com/2023/02/bitnami-arm-containers-available-at.html">Bitnami’s images on DockerHub now universally support ARM</a>, making practically the entirety of <a href="../../posts/2023-02-09-configuring-and-installing-prereqs/index.html">Part III</a> obsolete.</p>
<p>There are also discussions (perhaps only internally?) around refactoring the Helm chart to pull the prerequisites out entirely, refocusing instead on Mastodon itself.</p>
</section>
<section id="joining-mastodon-has-gotten-easier" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="joining-mastodon-has-gotten-easier">Joining Mastodon has gotten easier</h3>
<p>And honestly, it’s not like there’s a huge crowd of folks looking to run their own Mastodon instances, especially not with such a rich landscape of instances already up and running.</p>
<p>Granted, there doesn’t really seem to be a unified way of <em>finding</em> an interesting instance; that particular aspect of diving into Mastodon still feels very “cannot be found except by those who already know where it is.” That’s a bit orthogonal to the blog series—especially since I set up my own instance not because I couldn’t find what I was looking for, but because I just wanted to see if I could—but still an ongoing consideration.</p>
</section>
<section id="other-notes-on-the-process" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="other-notes-on-the-process">Other notes on the process</h3>
<p>I do want to strongly underscore <strong>how grateful I am to the Mastodon dev team for all their help through this process</strong>. I would very likely still be mired in getting search up and running without their knowledgeable, kind, and patient assistance. <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mastodon/">Go support Mastodon’s open source work and, as a bonus, receive access to their dev Discord</a>.</p>
<p>The official GitHub repository is also a wealth of information, and I cannot enumerate just how helpful it’s been since they moved the helm chart maintenance and development <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/chart/">into its own repository</a>, separate from the <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/">main Mastodon application</a>.</p>
<p>My biggest gripe with this whole process really just boils down to the complexity of kubernetes and its ecosystem. There is <em>so. much. stuff.</em> to understand to get even the most basic kubernetes applications up and running. Helm is helpful—in a way—because it hides so much of this complexity, but this becomes a double-edged sword when <em>invariably</em> something isn’t working quite right. Frankly, with the lone exception of the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner">NFS provisioner</a> I use for storage in kubernetes applications, I have yet to install an application via Helm that <em>didn’t</em> also require diving into the <code>values.yaml</code> and backend templates to figure out what was <em>really</em> going on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don’t have an easy answer, either. For someone well-versed in kubernetes and its ecosystem, this whole process probably would have taken a day; for me, it took a month. I’m ok with that, because I learned a lot from the process of doing it myself, but I’m also more cognizant now of just how much I still don’t know about kubernetes.</p>
<p>Until this unfathomably steep learning curve is smoothed out a little, I feel that it’s incumbent upon us who’ve dabbled somewhat in kubernetes to help lift up the folks coming behind us. Hence this blog series!</p>
</section>
<section id="final-final-notes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-final-notes">Final, final notes</h3>
<p>Is there anything I missed? Anything that isn’t clear? Please feel free to drop a comment on this post or any of the previous ones if you have some additional thoughts on the topics.</p>
<p>I’ve also gone back and added links to all the posts in the series to all the other posts in this series, so you won’t have to click through sequentially to see them all.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed putting this series together, and I already have some ideas for similar undertakings, both within and without the world of kubernetes (perhaps I’ll finally have a blog series around something ML and/or CV related, zomg). Until then!</p>

<p>The <code>dep update</code> will pull down any new versions of the Bitnami charts needed to install the prerequisites we went over in <a href="../../posts/2023-02-09-configuring-and-installing-prereqs/index.html">Part III</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>install</code> command creates an application called <code>mastodon</code>, using the templates in the current directory (hence <code>./</code>), creates a new k3s namespace named <code>mastodon</code> for all the pods to occupy, and then the <code>-f</code> flag provides a path to the <code>values.yaml</code> file we customized back in <a href="../../posts/2023-01-25-mastodon-helm-chart/index.html">Part II</a>.</p>
<section id="is-that-it" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-that-it">Is that it?</h3>
<p>A lot of things are going to happen at this point.</p>
<p>First, there a couple of pods that will appear as one-time “jobs”, the most notable (to me) of which is the <code>precompile</code> pod. This one in particular <em>can take awhile</em>… or maybe it was just because it was running on little Raspberry Pi SBCs; the 4Bs are certainly fast, but they’re still pretty resource-constrained by workstation or server standards, so be patient here. Just because it’s taking awhile for anything to show up doesn’t mean something is wrong.</p>
<p>Second, there is a db-migrate job that kicks off. Despite the name, this actually happens both if you’re migrating <em>and</em> if you’re installing Mastodon for the first time. For some reason, there’s a race condition among these initial one-time pods, and if the db-migrate job doesn’t kick off right when it’s supposed to, it may never happen; there’s <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/chart/issues/18">an open ticket looking at this problem</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/chart/pull/37">PR with a proposed fix that hasn’t yet been merged</a>. It’s something to keep an eye on; there are manual fixes specified in the open issue (basically the pod equivalent of turn-off-and-back-on) that I had to employ at least a couple of times.</p>
<p>Finally, there was an issue with sidekiq not properly registering the ingress task–kind of important for an application that relies heavily on ingress activity! But it required a very simple one-line addition to the <code>values.yaml</code> file, and it’s not even an issue anymore since <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/chart/pull/1">this PR was merged</a> back in early December 2022.</p>
</section>
<section id="yep-thats-it" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="yep-thats-it">Yep, that’s it</h3>
<p>And that’s pretty much it! You should have a shiny new Mastodon instance up and running at this point (hit the ingress endpoint to check it out)! Your work as instance administrator is only just beginning, though–you need to check out all the options you have available in terms of setting up and configuring your instance (creating its welcome message and purpose, setting up how new accounts register, and importing any new emojis you might want), but in terms of command line kubernetes, with the exception of continued maintenance and occasional updates, that’s it!</p>
<p>I’ll have a wrap-up post coming soon with more of my own thoughts on the whole process.</p>

</ol>
<p>I want to start by saying: I am no expert here. As such, it is not only possible, but is in fact likely, that I was missing something so painfully obvious as to be worthy of derision for the rest of my natural life.</p>
<p>To be fair, that’d be mean, but still very possibly deserved.</p>
<p>When I started the whole Mastodon installation process, I loosely followed the <a href="https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/recipes/kubernetes/mastodon/">recipe outlined here at Geek Cookbook</a>, which—until this series of blog posts!—was the only resource I could find anywhere on the world wide interwubs on installing Mastodon on kubernetes (thank you again, funkypenguin; <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/funkypenguin">go sponsor him!</a>).</p>
<p>Of course, I could only follow it to a point; I didn’t make use of <a href="https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/kubernetes/deployment/flux/">flux</a> (though I know I really, really should; that’s a blog series for another time, methinks) so a lot of the constructs weren’t precisely relevant to me. As such there was a lot I had to infer. <a href="https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/kubernetes/ingress/">Ingress was no exception</a>.</p>
<section id="so-much-traeffik" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-much-traeffik">So much tra[e|f]fik</h3>
<p>This bit is actually entirely separate from Mastodon; it just <em>felt</em> like it was part of Mastodon, since it was Mastodon that I couldn’t reach. When SSL is misconfigured, your experience is strictly browser-dependent: in my case, Chrome<sup>1</sup> would throw up myriad warnings and, in regular mode, wouldn’t let me navigate to the page at all. In incognito mode, it would allow me to navigate there provided I clicked a link to acknowledge I was doing something “unsafe”.</p>
<p>So let’s back up a bit. I’m using <a href="https://traefik.io/">traefik</a> as my ingress controller. Not, I should add, because it’s packaged with k3s; I actually disabled that because it’s an old version. Rather, I installed traefik via <a href="https://github.com/traefik/traefik-helm-chart">its official helm chart</a>.</p>
<p>Now. In keeping with my philosophy of doing the simplest thing that gets results, I tried for the http-01 option when it came to <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/">Let’s Encrypt challenge modes</a>, as it’s by far the most straightforward, at least when it comes to configuring the ingress. I had to make only very minor modifications to the traefik helm chart; it ended up looking something like this:</p>

<p>This is what I saw appear over and over on <a href="https://letsdebug.net/">Let’s Debug</a> (thank you for that website, by the way!). No matter what (http-01) configuration I tried, this was what came back: timeouts.</p>
<p>As best I can tell, <a href="https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/issues/3238#issuecomment-1384438850">this recent comment on GitHub</a> miiight identify the source of the problem and how to fix it:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>So basically, your node cannot access http://1.2.3.4/.well-known/whatever and http://your-page.com/.well-known/whatever, but computers on the internet (such as letsencrypt) can.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>though I’m still not certain, because the method for testing this eventuality (<code>dig</code> or <code>curl</code>ing the URL from the kubernetes nodes themselves) worked fine for me.</p>
<p>After (I kid you not) an entire <strong>week</strong> of this, I gave up. It was time to switch to dns-01.</p>
</section>
<section id="its-always-dns" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="its-always-dns">It’s always DNS</h3>
<p>This took more doing. First, I moved my DNS nameservers from Google over to Cloudflare (Google was and continues to be my domain name provider, so initially that’s where my nameservers were, too). The reason for this move was because Google charges for DNS API access (which we’re going to need in a minute), whereas Cloudflare does not<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Second, I created API keys with Cloudflare specifically for modifying DNS entries. The cert-manager documentation has a whole page on dns-01 verification steps <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/cloudflare/">and uses Cloudflare as its examplar</a>.</p>
<p>FUN LITTLE FACTOID: Using the method outlined in the cert-manager documentation, I still encountered weird errors involving “invalid request headers.” <em>For whatever bloody reason</em>, when creating the <code>Secret</code> that stores the Cloudflare API tokens, I had to use <code>data</code> rather than <code>stringData</code> otherwise it simply wouldn’t work. <a href="https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/issues/3021#issuecomment-861894010">Here’s the solution</a>. It also needs to be in the same namespace as Mastodon. Also also, I needed to use <code>api-key</code>, <code>api-token</code>, and <code>email</code> fields, <a href="https://go-acme.github.io/lego/dns/cloudflare/">since these are specific to the permissions LE will need</a>.</p>
<p>Third, I had to make more modifications to the traefik helm chart. These included flipping the <code>certResolver.leresolver</code> from <code>httpChallenge</code> to <code>dnsChallenge</code>, and also included adding environment variables for each of the <code>data</code> fields in the cloudflare API secret. Here’s what those changes looked like:</p>

<p>I wouldn’t call this super-complicated, but it definitely wasn’t the ease of http-01 configuration. But unlike http-01, this actually worked!</p>

<p>Oddly enough, this was the part that took the longest on the road to getting my own Mastodon instance running. Not the <a href="../../posts/2023-01-23-mastodon-home-network-topology/index.html">obfuscated and undocumented network topology hiccups</a>, not the <a href="../../posts/2023-02-09-configuring-and-installing-prereqs/index.html">literally incompatible and also required prerequisites</a>; no, we got to bang our heads against a 9-year old technology that took nearly a week to find a working configuration.</p>
<p>I’ve had some folks suggest <a href="https://github.com/nabsul/kcert">kcert</a> as a drop-in replacement for cert-manager. For specific use-cases it certainly seems as though its simplicity could grease the skids of development; personally, I did not have a chance to try it out before landing on a working dns-01 setup, but I wanted to mention it as others have spoken positively about it.</p>
<p>Another promising bit of technology the Mastodon devs pointed me to was <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a>, which recently released their own implementation of <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1153/enabling-https/">HTTPS certificates</a> for nodes on a tailscale network. Traefik has even started working on <a href="https://traefik.io/blog/exploring-the-tailscale-traefik-proxy-integration/">integrating tailscale network overlays into its proxy configuration</a>, so this could be worth looking at instead of LE in the very near future.</p>

  <title>Setting up a wildlife camera</title>

<p>For <em>years</em>, I’ve been wanting to set up an outdoor wildlife camera. Somewhere in the <a href="https://pyimagesearch.com/pyimagesearch-gurus/">PyImageSearch forums</a><sup>1</sup> there’s a post from 2017-me remarking on how excited I am to have finally gotten my hands on an Nvidia 1080 Ti and, therefore, sufficient horsepower to chew up streaming video from outdoors.</p>
<p>In case some readers are unaware: <a href="https://www.visitathensga.com/">Athens</a> is a quintessential college town where, even if starting from the middle of downtown, you’re only ever at most 15 minutes from literal cow pastures. As such, encounters with wildlife are frequent and to be expected if you’re spending any decent amount of time here.</p>
<section id="its-always-the-year-of-the-rabbit" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="its-always-the-year-of-the-rabbit">It’s always the year of the rabbit</h3>
<p>There was a stretch of time, also back around 2017 I think, where our bunny Clover would occasionally<sup>2</sup> wake us up in the middle of the night by thumping. Again, for those who may not know, <a href="https://www.rabbitcaretips.com/why-do-rabbits-thump-their-feet/">rabbits will thump if they sense danger</a> as a way of warning those around them. Clover in particular is also known to thump when she’s having fun, but these few times when we woke up and checked, she was doing her best statue imitation in between thumps, strongly suggesting she really was scared of… something.</p>
<p>We never figured out what, exactly. Best guess: her super-sensitive rabbit ears + eyes picked up something prowling outside in the dark that our duller human senses just couldn’t perceive. Which also gave me a specific application for night cameras beyond simple curiosity: to try and figure out what, if anything, was making Clover nervous (I even had an idea to include some kind of seismometer so I could sync up the offline video analysis with Clover’s thumps, but it’s been years since she last woke us up with thumping so I figure I missed the moment).</p>

<p>But I was still curious about the nearby wildlife. This only intensified in the summer of 2021: unusually ravenous deer<sup>3</sup> ate all the lilies in our front yard before they even bloomed. An idea formed to sync a night camera up with a programmable drone that could, after identifying the deer in the yard, harass them away from the lilies. Oddly, summer 2022 was a return to normal: only one flower was eaten early on in the season; the other few dozen went through their full lifecycle, never getting eaten.</p>
<p>But even so, I still wanted to see what was cruising around our neighborhood.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bring-on-the-over-engineered-solution">Bring on the over-engineered solution</h3>
<p>Yes, dear reader–years have passed in this retelling with little to no progress on the wildlife front. I will readily admit this project suffered what most personal projects do. I will say this, though: in my defense, 2018 through 2021 was the back half of my tenure-track appointment. Couple that with welcoming my daughter, and the onset of a global pandemic… yeah. A liiiiittle bit of burnout<sup>4</sup>, plus a LOT of higher-priority items to worry about than a wildlife camera for the sake of curiosity.</p>
<p>But by summer 2022, I finally had something physically taking shape–<a href="../../posts/2022-07-13-the-raspberry-pi-cluster/index.html">head over to my July 2022 blog post to check it out, complete with photos</a>! I even mounted the birdhouse outside, calibrated the camera’s field of view, and wired it all up… but then left it for several more months.</p>
<p>Now I’m <em>finally</em> getting some hard, empirical data on how it’s all working. And man, it’s going to be a challenge to have this work well.</p>
</section>
<section id="technical-challenges" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="technical-challenges">Technical challenges</h3>
<p>Legion.</p>
<p>By far the biggest challenge I’m dealing with is <strong>how resource-constrained the Raspberry Pi 3B+ is</strong>. I’m working with 1GB of RAM, though the effective memory available at any given moment is maaaybe 75% of that; as such, <strong>66%</strong> is the safe margin I operate with. Another limitation is the SD card size (effectively the hard drive of the Pi): at least when I purchased it, the limit was 32GB. That’s now no longer the case, but I haven’t gotten around to reformatting it, so it’s still a 32GB limit for now.</p>
<p>This effectively means that capturing lots of video for testing purposes is difficult. Even reasonable resolutions like 1280x720 at 30fps will exhaust the little Pi’s memory after a mere <strong>4 minutes</strong> of video capture, assuming all the buffering was happening in RAM.</p>
<p>I looked into streaming the video directly as it’s captured; that was, after all, the idea I had behind purchasing the 1080 Ti back in 2017. However, the 3B+ wifi operates only on the 2.4GHz band, which… is unfortunately shared by our baby monitor. Thus, whenever the Pi is transferring data over the air, the baby monitor becomes completely unusable.</p>
<p>So the upshot here is</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I need to dramatically downsample the incoming video feed, and</li>
<li>any real-time processing I want to do (including downsampling) has to be done on the Pi itself</li>
</ol>
<p>I have been looking into things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet">power-over-ethernet</a> to try and solve #2 (though it would require running an ethernet cable outside, which has its own challenges), and I’ve been running some experiments on the most effective downsampling methods for #1. I’ve also been strongly considering simply upgrading the Pi to a 4B when they become available again, as they can operate on the 5GHz wifi band, and can go up to 8GB of memory. Together, these two immediate fixes would dramatically simplify the situation. But Pi 4s most likely won’t be readily available again until Q2 this year (a few months from now, at least).</p>
</section>
<section id="logistical-challenges" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="logistical-challenges">Logistical challenges</h3>
<p>There are a ton of unknowns when it comes to what <em>kind</em> of data I can expect. Already the few experiments I’ve run have shown a wide variability in the video I capture in the context of trying to decide on-the-fly what to keep and what to discard.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2">Picamera2 library</a> also recently entered “beta” (from “alpha”). While that’s most certainly a positive development, it still means the library is undergoing substantial changes, and so not only may functionality change very suddenly, but–as I’ve already been encountering–existing functionality is often poorly documented, if at all. It took me some time to piece together how to configure both high-res and low-res video streams to capture the <em>full</em> field of view of the camera (relative to the camera’s native resolution), rather than cropping out a section, as is what would happen with most of the configurations in the <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2/tree/main/examples"><code>examples</code> folder</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah: I also have a full-time job, and a toddler. So those are definitely logistics to be considered.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="experiments">Experiments</h3>
<p>I have run a few experiments to get a feel for what to expect. The <a href="https://github.com/magsol/wildlife-cameras/blob/0881bf2043a0c5e97177105894508e3dfebacee6/src/noir.py">latest commit</a> (as of writing this post) shows what the experiments more or less look like. Here are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>A dual-stream video recording configuration, where the high-res is set to 1640x1232 and the low-res is 410x308.</li>
<li>The camera runs for a fixed period of time (in the script, it’s 8 hours).</li>
<li>During that time, a continuous loop does the following:
<ol type="1">
<li>Grab a frame from the low-res stream.</li>
<li>Convert this frame from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV">YUV</a> to grayscale (Picamera2 requires low-res feeds to be in YUV; fortunately, this step doesn’t seem too arduous).</li>
<li>Compare this frame to the <em>previous</em> frame by way of calculating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error">mean squared error</a> (MSE). This provides some measure of how much has changed from one sequential frame to the next.</li>
<li>If MSE exceeds some threshold, start recording a video with the high-res stream. Continue recording so long as MSE exceeds that threshold.</li>
<li>If MSE drops below that threshold <em>and stays there for a certain length of time</em>, stop the high-res stream.</li>
<li>Hang onto all MSE measurements.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the basic gist. It’s functional, if blunt. Fortunately, I’ve already collected some interesting data. For instance, here’s an MSE plot from one 8-hour experiment I ran. Important to note: these MSE measurements are <em>only</em> from the events that <em>exceeded</em> the MSE threshold (I’m running separate experiments to try and determine what a baseline MSE looks like).</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2023-02-15-calibrating-a-wildlife-camera/detected_motion_mse.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Matplotlib line plot showing multiple variable-length plots of MSE along the y-axis versus time on the x-axis."></p>
<p>One’s first reaction to this plot might be “Huh, there’s a wide variability in the things that can trigger MSE to exceed the threshold!”. And that would most certainly be correct. But even more complicating is the fact <em>ALL of these events are of the same thing</em>: a car driving by on the street. Not only is it not really something I’m interested in–it’s a wildlife camera, after all–but clearly MSE is ill-suited as a method for identifying the <em>kind</em> of event behind it.</p>
<p>I ran a second experiment over 10 minutes to investigate what MSE baselines might look like (and I’m currently running a longer one; results TBD), but basically you have something that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2023-02-15-calibrating-a-wildlife-camera/10min_test.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Matplotlib line plot showing a single plot of MSE along the y-axis versus time on the x-axis."></p>
<p>My take-away from this plot is: given the 30fps capture rate (or very close to it; at least, depending on how much real-time processing I try to cram in), very little changes from one frame to the next. Empirically, it’s a little more than a single pixel. However, there’s a lot this plot <em>doesn’t</em> tell me, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the effects of weather, such as wind or rain, on the baseline MSE? (not a clue)</li>
<li>How does absolute MSE change with respect to resolution, fps, or other camera settings? (in theory, MSE should scale with resolution; fps could at least be simulated by systematically downsampling, though upsampling would be more difficult)</li>
<li>What are the effects of night vs day on MSE? (again, in theory this shouldn’t be a huge deal, as I only plan to operate the camera at night)</li>
<li>How can MSE identify two separate events vs something like a person who stands still long enough to make it <em>seem</em> like two separate events? (it probably can’t)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, I’m running a 24-hour test right now that will hopefully provide at least a little more intuition into the role of MSE vs the real world, if not any outright answers to the above questions.</p>
<p>Finally, I did want to get some feel for the overall performance of the code itself. I wanted to try and understand what I was working with in terms of options for real-time processing. So I ran a profiler on the same 10-minute experiment I ran above, and this is what came back:</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2023-02-15-calibrating-a-wildlife-camera/profiling.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Output of the top `cumtime` hits from running cProfile on the 10-minute MSE experiment. Main take-away is that Picamera2 internals are by far the biggest time sink, by at least an order of magnitude."></p>
<p>This was comforting to see, as I had been worried the real-time conversion of YUV to grayscale may have been a bigger performance hit; turns out, it’s over two orders of magnitude less problematic than Picamera2 internals, and an order of magnitude less so than the <code>numpy.mean</code> function call for calculating MSE (and this is something I might be able to optimize a bit with some clever leveraging of in-memory data structures).</p>
<p>I was even able to look at the timestamping of the MSE calculations themselves to see that, by far, I was very close to the 30fps sampling rate of the camera itself, meaning I definitely have some head room for additional real-time operations. Granted, this concern has always been secondary to memory constraints, but still: it’s good to know where the hard limits are, and where we have some room to operate.</p>
</section>
<section id="ongoing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ongoing">Ongoing</h3>
<p>It’s clear that, if there are animals prowling around at night, they don’t elicit much of a reaction from MSE, meaning I’m going to need smarter methods of teasing them out. One thought I had was considering both MSE magnitude <em>and</em> duration, but for that I’d need a much more thorough understanding of the role of the baseline MSE (hence the 24-hour experiment). Another thought I had was combining this with a <em>window</em> of frames, rather than just instantaneous MSE over a pair of frames. Finally, I also wanted to look into some basic (non-DL) object detection in OpenCV, since considering first-order image features like edges and corners might be more sensitive to small animals walking around while also keeping added computationl and memory demands at a minimum.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preamble">Preamble</h3>
<p>As stated previously, the Mastodon image is fully arm64-compatible. However, if and until the dev team chooses to unbundle Mastodon from its dependencies in the Helm chart, we have to worry about multiple applications Mastodon relies on which themselves rely on images that are <em>not</em> arm64-compatible.</p>
<p>This isn’t exactly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency hell</a>, but it did bring to mind a recent blog post by <a href="https://vickiboykis.com/">Vicki Boykis</a>–who you should absolutely follow if you don’t already–about <a href="https://vickiboykis.com/2022/12/05/the-cloudy-layers-of-modern-day-programming/">how layered modern software engineering and programming have become</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Modern software is hard to develop locally, hard to build the internal logic for, and intrinsically hard to deploy, especially so in the case of machine learning. Just take a look at <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2205/2205.02302.pdf">the MLOps paper</a>, which I have nightmares about occasionally.</p>
<p>The problem has gotten so bad that you can usually no longer start from scratch and develop and test <a href="https://twitter.com/vboykis/status/1592576567305474049">a single piece of software in a single, preferably local environment</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone in the data science and machine learning space for the past decade+, I can definitely say that this is true. So I hope this post provides some clarity so you can proceed with installing arm64-compatible Mastodon without spending as much time as I did getting it to run.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-short-version" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-short-version">The short version</h3>
<p>The upshot is that the three major dependencies of Mastodon–redis, postgres, and elasticsearch–are all <a href="https://bitnami.com/">bitnami</a> images, and <strong>none of bitnami’s images are arm64-compatible</strong>.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/7305">there is a mega-thread open</a> discussing bitnami’s <em>eventual</em> migration to arm64-compatible images, but they’ve made it very clear that it just isn’t a priority for them right now)</p>
<p>In mid-November 2022, <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/chart/issues/22">this issue</a> was posted. I was still working on getting my own Mastodon instance up and running, so it wasn’t until <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/chart/issues/22#issuecomment-1350081697">Dec 1 that I was finally able to respond</a> with something concrete (though by no means a complete picture–I still couldn’t figure out what to do about elasticsearch).</p>
<p>My response should have some familiar notes from the previous post, specifically regarding the modifications that needed to be made to <code>Chart.yaml</code>.</p>
<p>Another user in the issue mentioned the <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/chart/issues/22#issuecomment-1363930695">“bitnami-compat” project</a>, which I highly recommend checking out, but which I didn’t end up using, for reasons I’ll get into later in this post.</p>
<p>The OP on the issue <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/discussions/22319">opened up a Discussion</a>, where I answered with the <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/discussions/22319#discussioncomment-4410612">short version</a> of what this post will contain (along with, again, some content from the last post). You can read that if you like, or continue here! Or both!</p>
<p>The key approach I took: rather than swapping out entire charts, I stuck with the bitnami charts referenced in the Mastodon chart, but modified the <em>images</em> each of the bitnami charts referred to. In this way, I could minimize the amount of yaml reconfiguration I was doing to keep things at a reasonable amount of crazy.</p>

<section id="postgresql" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="postgresql">postgresql</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL was the easiest change, at least if minimizing “number of switches I needed to flip” is our metric of choice here for determining easy versus difficult.</p>
<p>The only real change I needed to make was how I performed the <code>helm install</code> process of the bitnami chart for postgres. Here’s the command I used:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;

background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">\</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--set</span> global.postgresql.auth.username=<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"my_postgres_username"</span> <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">\</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--set</span> global.postgresql.auth.password=<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"my_postgres_password"</span> <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">\</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--set</span> global.postgresql.auth.database=<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"my_postgres_database"</span> <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">\</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--set</span> image.repository=<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"postgres"</span> <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">\</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--set</span> image.tag=<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"15.0"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s it. The only <em>real</em> change of note is the <code>image.repository</code> target: it’s pointing to the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres">official PostgreSQL image on DockerHub</a>, which has arm64-compatible images. The other items related to username, password, and database are items that need to be filled in anyway (here or in the <code>values.yaml</code> file), and the tag just ensures I’m using the same version that the bitnami image would have used, again to minimize any downstream conflicts.</p>
<p>And that was it! I used the bitnami <em>chart</em> with the postgres <em>image</em>, and it worked!</p>
</section>
<section id="redis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="redis">redis</h3>
<p>Next up, our in-memory data broker.</p>
<p>This process was largely the same as with PostgreSQL, with one notable deviation: I also set the flag to put redis in <code>standalone</code> mode, given that my Pi cluster is resource-constrained and couldn’t afford to have the HA version that, I believe, is the default for the bitnami chart.</p>
<p>Here’s the helm command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">helm</span> install redis bitnami/redis <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">\</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--set</span> global.redis.password=<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"my_redis_password"</span> <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">\</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--set</span> architecture=<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"standalone"</span> <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">\</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--set</span> image.repository=<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"redis"</span> <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">\</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--set</span> image.tag=<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"7.0"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Again, the password is something we need to set up anyway, the architecture is set to <code>standalone</code> to minimize its in-memory footprint, tag is meant to match with the bitnami version, and finally the <code>image.repository</code> points to the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/redis">official redis image on DockerHub</a> which, like PostgreSQL, has an arm64-compatible version.</p>
</section>
<section id="elasticsearch-opensearch" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="elasticsearch-opensearch"><del>elasticsearch</del> OpenSearch</h3>
<p>I tried to get elasticsearch to work. I really did.</p>
<p>I started off the same way as with postgres and redis: like the first two, there are <a href="https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/elasticsearch#global-parameters">only a few critical global parameters</a> that need to be set, and they’re the usual suspects–change the image registry to point to the official image on DockerHub, change the image tag to match the bitnami image version, and… that’s really about it.</p>
<p>The hang-ups, crashes, and reboots started immediately. Turns out, elasticsearch is <em>incredibly resource-intensive</em>. So I set about trying to set absolutely minimal overheads: setting master and data replicas to 1, constraining the java heap size, and disabling ingest… none of which worked.</p>
<p>Even aside from the resource constraints, there was a second problem. For whatever reason, the bitnami chart for elasticsearch has a <em>second</em> container–the “kernel settings modifier”–that is part of the pod, and which also has an image that, by default, is not compatible with ARM. So in theory, to get elasticsearch to work with the same technique, the following fields would also have to be changed in the helm chart:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1">    <span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--set</span> sysctlImage.registry=<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"ghcr.io"</span> <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">\</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--set</span> sysctlImage.repository=<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"zcube/bitnami-compat/bitnami-shell"</span> <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;

<span id="cb3-3">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;

background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"11.0.0-debian-11-r39"</span> <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">\</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is a bit different from the changes made with postgres and redis. There is no “official” distribution of the “kernel settings modifier” image, as this is exclusive to bitnami. Instead, we needed to go to the <a href="https://github.com/ZCube/bitnami-compat">bitnami-compat project</a> which is attempting to make bitnami-compatible arm64 images for all the major charts, and which could feasibly serve as drop-in replacements for redis and postgres as well (I just didn’t try them because I got them working before discovering bitnami-compat). But it’s perfect for this situation.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, this completely solved the architectural compatibility issues, but I still could not fix the resourcing problems without fundamentally hobbling elasticsearch to the point of futility.</p>
<p>Instead, I followed some advice from the Mastodon devs who have, unofficially, been able to get <a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/about/">OpenSearch to work as a drop-in elasticsearch replacement</a> in Mastodon.</p>
<p>(Side note: OpenSearch is based on Apache Lucene, which was the progenitor project to <a href="https://mahout.apache.org/">Apache Mahout</a>, for which I’m a member of its PMC! Small world. I love open source &lt;3 )</p>
<p>Turns out, OpenSearch is <em>remarkable</em>, both in its minimal resource usage <em>and</em> with its ease of dropping right in where elasticsearch would go. My only complaint was the chart’s use of a multi-line yaml string in its settings, which–to my limited knowledge and experience, at least–precluded its exclusive command-line use, and forced me instead to modify the <code>values.yaml</code> and pass that directly to helm. Still, there were very few modifications I needed to make–here’s an indicator with line numbers corresponding to <a href="https://github.com/opensearch-project/helm-charts/blob/c6ebc864c92e6d64cb2097269290193b3844a8e7/charts/opensearch/values.yaml">what is <em>currently</em> the latest version of the chart</a> (committed Jan 3, 2023):</p>

<p>That’s all I needed. Then by passing the edited <code>values.yaml</code> to <code>helm install</code>, it ran just fine.</p>

<p>That’s it for the prerequisites! At this point, you could pretty much spin up a Mastodon instance as configured. However, before getting to how I went about that process, I wanted to touch on one final problem I ran into, which–despite the nit-picky-ness of getting these arm64-compatible dependencies working–is where I <em>actually</em> spent most of my time trying to get Mastodon up and running: obtaining an SSL certificate through Let’s Encrypt.</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>

<p>Very recently, <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/chart/issues/22#issuecomment-1443232440">this post showed up</a> on a closed Mastodon helm chart ticket: it looks like Bitnami is now <strong>fully supporting ARM-compatible images on their DockerHub</strong> (I checked Postgres and it <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/postgresql/tags">does indeed have ARM tags on the builds</a>). I haven’t tried them out as of this update, but in theory it should more or less obviate the need for this entire post! Hooray, progress!</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, dear reader, but when I first started this journey into teaching myself kubernetes, I was elated at the prospect of Helm: a “package manager for kubernetes”, it said! Thank the cloudless heavens; I was getting so bogged down with managing separate yaml files, I was thrilled at the prospect of someone just setting some reasonable defaults and packaging it all together.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introducing-the-mastodon-chart">Introducing the Mastodon chart</h3>
<p>You can find the latest version of the Mastodon chart <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/chart">here</a>.</p>
<p>I should mention: when I started working on this in early December, the chart was actually still part of the main Mastodon repo! This meant that changes were much slower to be merged, and as a result I had to implement some workarounds that have since been fixed in the newest chart. Even so, I’ll point out 1) any changes I made, 2) whether those changes still need to be made now, and 3) relevant PRs.</p>
<p>The chart repo’s README linked above provides pretty good instructions for getting up and running. Or, in my case, to get some initial error messages that pointed me where I needed to go next.</p>
<p>At the bare minimum, <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/chart#configuration"><em>everyone</em> has to fill in</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>the whole <code>mastodon.secrets</code> section (four keys)</li>
<li>the <code>postgres</code> and <code>redis</code> sections (whether or not they’re enabled in the chart)</li>
<li>the <code>mastodon.stmp</code> section for the mailer’s SMTP settings (not <em>technically</em> required, but nobody will be able to register with your instance or reset their passwords without them)</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of my circumstances, I also had to modify the <code>elasticsearch</code> section (that’s another bitnami image that wasn’t ARM-compatible, like redis and postgres; but I’m leaving all three of these for the next post!), the <code>ingress</code> section (because I was running <a href="https://github.com/traefik/traefik-helm-chart">traefik</a> instead of the default nginx), and the <code>mastodon.persistence</code> section (because I was using a local NAS for storage–I know, not recommended for production, but for a two-user instance? no problem).</p>
<p>So with that lengthy introduction and background out of the way, the salient points here and the primary guiding principles in diving into the chart are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Disabling</em> the dependencies (elasticsearch, redis, postgres) so I could install them myself later (next post!)</li>
<li><em>Adding</em> NAS storage as the primary storage mechanism (I was using <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner">nfs subdir external provisioner</a>)</li>
<li><em>Configuring</em> ingress to work with traefik instead of nginx</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-easy-stuff-storage-and-ingress">The “easy” stuff: storage and ingress</h3>
<p>Probably the easiest modification to make was the storage. Under <code>mastodon.persistence</code>, there are two main groups: <code>assets</code> and <code>system</code>. They both have their own persistent volumes in case you need to dramatically alter their respective configurations, but I went with the default, adding only one line to each subsection (since <code>storageClassName</code> wasn’t even listed in the default chart, but has templates in the backend that will handle the key-values if provided):</p>

<p>That’s it! Mischief managed.</p>
<p>For ingress, things were a little more complicated. Not because it required more configuration in the chart itself, but because it required more configuration <em>ahead of using the chart at all</em>. The ingress configuration in the Mastodon chart itself masks the hours spent getting traefik set up exactly the way I wanted. Sadly, this is beyond the scope of the Mastodon instance setup (it will definitely appear in a blog post about just getting my k3s cluster off the ground!), but I <em>will</em> discuss configuring the TLS support / SSL certificates in a later post in this series, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>Here was my configuration (changes from the current default are marked, and comments are deleted for brevity):</p>

<p>That’s it! Relatively tame modifications, but belie a groundswell of configuration and wrangling that had already happened. In particular, note the <code>tls.secretName</code> field: I may not have modified it, but I did have to create a Secret named <code>mastodon-tls</code> ahead of deploying the chart! That was part of the magic of cert-manager behind the scenes, communicating with Let’s Encrypt and getting an SSL certificate set up (again, a future post–stay tuned).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-harder-stuff-disabling-dependencies-and-modifying-templates">The harder stuff: disabling dependencies and modifying templates</h3>
<p>Ok, disabling the dependencies was actually easy. Here’s all it took:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to <code>redis</code>, <code>postgresql</code>, and <code>elasticsearch</code> sections</li>
<li>Each one has an <code>enabled:</code> key–set it to <code>false</code></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it! They’re disabled. <strong>Your Helm chart is now fully ARM-compatible!</strong></p>
<p>…except by disabling all the bitnami charts, you’ve introduced an insidious bug where, for some reason, the <a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/common">Bitnami Common Library chart</a> can no longer be found. Fortunately, the fix is easy.</p>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/chart/blob/main/Chart.yaml">Chart.yaml file</a> and add a new entry under the <code>dependencies:</code> list:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb3-1"><span class="at" style="color: #657422;

<p>Now when you run <code>helm dep update</code> before installing the chart, the Common chart will still be downloaded and everything will work, even with the other bitnami dependencies disabled.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this leaves us with the trickiest part of the Helm chart modifications: actually tweaking the redis, postgres, and elasticsearch sections (and, in some cases, templates!) to work with the separate instances we’ll spin up later.</p>
<p><strong>Elasticsearch</strong> doesn’t require any extra tweaking, so we can leave that alone for now.</p>
<p><strong>Postgres</strong> needs the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>postgresqlHostname</code>: postgres automatically spits this out when you succesfully install it for the first time, so just copy/paste from that</li>
<li><code>postgresqlPort</code>: this is almost always 5432, to the point where that’s the default in the helm chart’s backend template</li>
<li><code>auth.database</code>, <code>auth.username</code>, and <code>auth.password</code> / <code>auth.postgresPassword</code> are set <strong>by you, the user</strong> when you install postgres separately; we’ll go over this in the following blog post</li>
<li>it’s very important to note that <code>auth.password</code> and <code>auth.postgresPassword</code> <strong>should have the same value</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, <strong>redis</strong> needs the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hostname</code>: like postgres, this is spit out automatically when you successfully spin up redis for the first time, so take note of it and copy/paste it here</li>
<li><code>password</code>: this is set <strong>by you, the user</strong> when you install redis separately; we’ll go over this in the following blog post</li>
<li>weirdly, I needed to set <code>auth.existingSecret</code> too</li>
</ul>
<p>To the last point, I created the following <code>redis-password.yaml</code> file:</p>

<p>Running <code>kubectl apply -f redis-password.yaml</code> into the Mastodon namespace got it working. I still don’t know why I needed both the Secret and the password in the helm chart to get it to work–it may work with just the Secret, or maybe whatever weird situation caused it was fixed and now just the password in the helm chart will work–but this operation was fairly simple and got everything working so I went with it. I <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/20819">created a PR for this</a> a few months back, but it was rolled into a broader PR tasked with migrating the chart over to its own repository, so I’m not sure if its fixes were ever implemented.</p>
<p>There were some changes directly to the <code>templates/configmap-env.yaml</code> file that were needed, but thankfully many of these have already been addressed courtesy of some PRs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/19678">Fix helm postgresql secret</a> (#19678)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mastodon/chart/pull/6">Allow external redis instance</a> (#6, replaces <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/20322">#20322</a>)</li>

</ul>

<section id="thanks-helm" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thanks-helm">Thanks Helm!</h3>
<p>That about does it for setting up the Helm chart and its corresponding values ahead of installing it… which we won’t actually do for a couple more blog posts yet.</p>
<p>For now, I need to rewind a bit to go over 1) how to install the dependencies we just spent an entire blog post disabling and then configuring anyway, and 2) how to get SSL to work.</p>
<p>Once we get those items squared away, then we can circle back to the completed Helm chart and install a functioning Mastodon instance! Isn’t being a sysadmin great?!</p>

<p>Admittedly, this post in the series will be less “here’s how to spin up your own instance” than “here’s why I had so many problems that are specific just to me”, so if you have a solid handle on your own home network topology and/or are a DNS savant, feel free to skip this post.</p>
<p>For the rest of us mere networking mortals, let me walk you through a network hiccup that has been stymieing my attempt at an honest-to-goodness homelab kubernetes cluster for the better part of the last couple years.</p>
<section id="thanks-a-lot-bezos" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thanks-a-lot-bezos">Thanks a lot, Bezos</h3>
<p>During the height of the pandemic in summer 2020–and somewhat in preparation for the birth of our daughter–I performed some long-overdue home network upgrades. This included 1) switching over to fiber internet, and 2) upgrading to a mesh network, rather than the janky router-plus-extender setup that honestly never really worked all that well. The router itself was already 5+ years old (purchased when we first moved into the house), so it needed an upgrade anyway.</p>
<p>At the recommendation of some friends, I went with <a href="https://eero.com/">eero</a>. Honestly, I’d still recommend it: it’s been rock-solid, with no problems between my Apple devices (MBP, iPad Pro, and iPhone), my wife’s Android+Windows devices (Surface, Pixels), and our myriad <a href="https://twitter.com/internetofshit">internet-of-sh!t devices</a> strewn throughout the house. Literally zero problems, which I honestly can’t even say for our old router.</p>
<p>…with, I suppose, one exception: putting the eeros into bridge mode.</p>
</section>
<section id="bridge-mode-is-not-what-you-think-it-is" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bridge-mode-is-not-what-you-think-it-is">Bridge mode is not what you think it is</h3>
<p>As far as I’m aware, across all devices–from ISP modems to VirtualBox to Docker to home routers–the term “bridge mode” has a common intuition: it means the device that has been placed into bridge mode relinquishes any intelligent packet organizing methods it may have been using before and simply acts as a simple “bridge” between whatever entities it is connected to. As such, it doesn’t really care what those entities are, it just passes traffic between them.</p>
<p>Not so with eeros.</p>
<p>To illustrate, here is what my home network looked like <em>before</em> starting any of this craziness.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2023-01-23-mastodon-home-network-topology/original.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="My home network setup pre-Mastodon, where the main eero connects directly to the AT&amp;T modem and acts as the chief router and DHCP server of the household."></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Why yes, I did configure MoCA for my home mesh, thanks for asking.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This setup worked, except… see that Raspberry Pi cluster in the bottom left? That’s where I installed k3s for tinkering, but “tinkering” is pretty much all anything amounted to, because eeros have an odd limitation when it comes to port forwarding: <strong>they don’t allow IP-based service forwarding</strong>, or at least, service forwarding that is based <strong>solely</strong> on IP addresses; they also require MAC addresses. When dealing with ephemeral services created by kubernetes clusters on floating IP ranges, there aren’t associated MAC addresses with these services, which makes it impossible to use software-based load balancers like <a href="https://metallb.universe.tf/">metallb</a>, and therefore impossible to deploy multiple services that use similar configurations–like, say, multiple websites: Mastodon and something else.</p>
<p>So the first thing I had to do, were I to run my own instance, was to figure out a network configuration that would allow me to do IP-based port forwarding. I recalled that my old router had this ability, so I figured: let’s just pull that out of retirement and use it purely for port forwarding!</p>
<p>Following was my first attempt. Note the major changes: the router has taken the place of the “main” eero as connecting directly to the ISP modem, and what was formerly the “main” eero is now just a wireless access point, connected to nothing <em>except</em> the router.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2023-01-23-mastodon-home-network-topology/first_bridge_attempt.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="My initial attempt at a home network setup that re-integrated my old router which could perform IP-based port forwarding. It took the place of the main eero by connecting to the ISP modem, and what had been the main eero was now just another access point, connected only to the now-unretired router."></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">My first attempt at putting the eeros in bridge mode and un-retiring my old router.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Suffice to say, this didn’t work. I mean, it <em>kind of</em> worked: the Raspberry Pi cluster was getting the right traffic forwarded to it. But seemingly random devices on the network would, suddenly and for no reason I could discern, disconnect and refuse to reconnect unless the <em>entire network</em> was rebooted.</p>
<p>Not exactly a tenable situation. So I reverted to the previous configuration where the eeros were in charge while I tried to figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>Fast forward about 8 months. I finally, <em>finally</em> found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eero/comments/nxlspa/psa_bridge_mode_is_not_what_you_think_it_is/">this post on Reddit</a> (because why would eero have it in their technical support documents?) from a couple years ago, with this critical element:</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2023-01-23-mastodon-home-network-topology/eero_bridge_network.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Screenshot of one post from the previous Reddit link, summarizing the precise network topology and positioning of the main eero in the sequence that eero expects in order to function correctly in bridge mode."></p>
<p>Apparently, even in bridge mode, there has to be at least one eero that can “see” the entirety of your home network (i.e., all incoming traffic should pass through it).</p>
<p>This… made absolutely no sense to me, as it directly contravened my understanding of “bridge mode”. But I went with it, and retooled my network to follow this new bit of information.</p>
<p>Here was my next attempt. Like my previous attempt, the router is connected directly to the ISP model. However, <em>unlike</em> my previous attempt, what was the “main” eero in the original configuration–while still connected to the router–now sits between the router and <em>the entire rest of the home network</em>, rather than just the router and… whatever devices deign to connect wirelessly to it.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2023-01-23-mastodon-home-network-topology/newest_topology.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="My final attempt at a home network setup that re-integrated my old router which could perform IP-based port forwarding. This took into account that at least one eero still needed to be able to see all the incoming traffic, so I made sure there was one situated in between the now-unretired router and the rest of the home network. This seemed to resolve the issues and has been my stable configuration for several months now."></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">My final attempt at a network reconfiguration, this time putting one eero ahead of the rest of the home network.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This configuration, while still strange to me, officially works–or at least, it’s worked for the past few months with no issues.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="load-balancers-green">Load balancers: green</h3>
<p>With the issue of the k3s Raspberry Pi cluster being able to receive incoming traffic from the wider internet effectively resolved, I could now undertake the process of installing a Mastodon instance on the cluster with gusto.</p>
<p>In the next post, we’ll look at the <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/chart">Mastodon Helm chart</a> in all its glory. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>As I mentioned in my previous post, I spent the last month of last year spinning up my own Mastodon instance (<a href="https://quinnwitz.house/">which you can check out</a>!) I’ve had a Raspberry Pi cluster of 5x Pi 4B modules sitting around for the better part of the last two years<sup>1</sup>. I’ve occasionally toyed with installing <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a> and experimenting with various bits and pieces of kubernetes, but never actually deployed something I found useful.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong–I do want to go over how I installed and configured k3s on my Raspberry Pi cluster. It’s remarkable how quickly this area of things moves, and the guides I was working off for this were all 2-3 years old, and <em>remarkably</em> outdated. So a more recent tutorial on that basic component would definitely have its niche, I think.</p>
<p>But first, I want to kick off a series of posts detailing how I got a Mastodon instance running! It took a surprising amount of wrangling, so I wanted to share my experience before I forget the tiny details.</p>
<p>Why would you be interested in this series? Aside from the usual rough-and-tumble of installing anything on kubernetes via <a href="https://helm.sh/">helm</a>, the two parts that took the greatest amount of time and effort were 1) getting the Mastodon <em>dependencies</em> to work, and 2) wrestling <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> into submission. That first point is interesting because while Mastodon itself works just fine on ARM, the default images included in the Mastodon helm chart for the dependencies do <em>NOT</em>, and so it won’t work out-of-the-box on a Raspberry Pi cluster<sup>2</sup>. And the second point was just plain rage-inducing, and I’d love for folks to not have to experience that.</p>
<p>I’ll fill in the links as I write the posts, so that you can bookmark this page if you’d like, though I’ll make sure to include the links on the other posts as well as I write them. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to drop any pointers / corrections / questions!</p>

</div>
<p>2022 was a fucking shitshow.</p>
<p>Forget the transition out of academia that fell flat on its fucking face in the final mile<sup>1</sup>. Forget the actual running that went from runway to runway, gunning the engine and building some speed on occasion but without ever quite taking off. Forget 2022’s parting shot of giving our entirely family COVID within days of the year’s end (save our daughter, miraculously and thankfully) when we’ve been so diligent for three fucking years. Forget that we’ve been pretty much the only ones still wearing masks on planes and at our daughter’s daycare, as if “I’ve decided to get on with my life” somehow makes the pandemic over simply by willing it; as if it’s impossible to “get on with life” while also taking basic fucking precautions that hurt no one and help everyone.</p>
<p>All of that was rage-inducing beyond words and each deserve their own posts to really break down. But the real story of my 2022 was of burnout that I foolishly thought I could outrun.</p>
<section id="burnout-dances-to-its-own-tune" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="burnout-dances-to-its-own-tune">Burnout dances to its own tune</h3>
<p>I’ve been burned out for quite awhile now; realistically, there are likely roots going all the way back to graduate school, but things really kicked into gear with the tenure-track position and the stress it brought.</p>
<p>The pandemic didn’t create anything new in this regard, but it did act as a force multiplier, frying what little bandwidth I had left and forcing me to confront just how toxic my working circumstances were.</p>
<p>This was all complicated by the birth of my daughter, happening at the same time as my promotion and tenure process, wrapped up in some of the most gratuitous displays of academia’s <em>utter disdain</em> both for growing families and, it turns out, straightforward public health guidelines around pandemic mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, when I landed a job at Quansight in mid-late 2021, I jumped at the possibility of an exit strategy. Admittedly, I jumped way, way too soon: I was worried of losing the opportunity if I waited (irony), I didn’t have anything approximating a concrete exit strategy from academia (haste), and I thought I could hold down two positions long enough to gracefully exit (fucking LOL).</p>
</section>
<section id="writing-on-the-wall" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="writing-on-the-wall">Writing on the wall</h3>
<p>Even when I formalized a sabbatical beginning August 2022–an entire <em>eight months</em> after I started working full-time at Quansight–I was so far beyond any kind of discernible burnout threshold that it’s a miracle I lasted another three months before leaving.</p>
<p>Through all of 2022, my burnout was so severe that entire consecutive weeks would go by where I napped <em>daily</em> just to make it through the day. I was besieged by migraine headaches at the base of my neck that radiated down my legs; they wouldn’t respond to ibuprofen, and made literally any activity impossible. By the fall, I was having these migraines 3-4 days a <em>week</em>. But the <em>coup de gr<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7Ba%7D">ce</em>, the real cherry on top of it all was how, on a given work week in 2022, my upper bound for productivity was probably about 25% efficiency.</p>
<p>Yes, I typed that correctly: on a given 40-hour work week, I at my peak could probably crank out about 10 hours of real, actual work. Most of the time, I was operating at some sigma less than that. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBfTrjPSShs">I’ll take my promotion now</a>.</p>
<p>The weirdest thing about this level of burnout probably answers the obvious burning question following that previous revelation: I had no idea this was all related, or that there was even really a problem. The headaches were annoying, the naps made things bearable (in a sense), and surely I was just still getting the hang of things and I’d soon start churning out productive weeks? After all, I just had to hold out until I could sever all ties to academia in… 6-8 more months.</p>
<p>About that.</p>

</div>
<p>To address the (one of many, I suspect) elephant in the room: wasn’t I on sabbatical from my academic role? Yes, dear reader, I was. And it was still requiring at least a handful of hours from me, on a good week. Some sabbatical.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, October. Our entire family got RSV in the second half of October. Didn’t I mention that earlier? No? Yeah, that was an entire week where all three of us were sick (so no daycare for kiddo), followed by a second week where my daughter and I developed secondary bacterial infections! Great for the aforementioned productivity!</p>

<p>If there’s anything positive to be said about burnout, it’s this: eventually, it gives you no choice. You reach a point where it’s physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, ecumenically, and grammatically <em>impossible</em> to keep moving forward.</p>
<p>Without going into detail<sup>2</sup>, that point came just before Thanksgiving. I left Quansight. I took the entire month of December off. And hooooooly shit y’all, but that month was, honest-to-goodness, maybe the first time in over a year I not only stopped digging the burnout hole deeper, but <em>actually started filling it back in</em>. I can’t describe the feeling of my brain lighting up and making connections and actually <em>functioning</em>–I spun up our household Mastodon instance in that time<sup>3</sup>! I actually recovered a bit, holy <em>fuck</em>.</p>
<p>And only then did I slowly begin to realize how absolutely <em>fucked</em> I’d been the entire year up until that point. How the <em>fuck</em> did I expect to be able to continue down this road for another <em>six to eight MONTHS</em>?</p>
<p>It seems ridiculous–laughable, if it didn’t border so close to outright dangerous–but only in hindsight.</p>

<p>My 2022 was defined by my burnout… but also by my realization of its full extent. And, in doing so, by the start of me turning things around.</p>
<p>Beyond burnout, there were some other events and accomplishments in 2022 that were cause for celebration by themselves.</p>
<p>My wife quit the job that was stifling her and is now pursuing her dreams as a full-time fiction writer. This was one of the very first things I learned about her all those years ago when we met<sup>4</sup>, and the fact that she’s living it now–and all the challenges and anxieties and freedoms and blessings it comes with–makes me prouder than I’ve been of anyone in years.</p>
<p>Speaking of my wife and her writing, she finished a complete draft of the book she’s been working on for the past bit. I finished reading it a week or so ago, and I <em>fucking love it</em>. I may be a little biased, but I also read 30 books last year according to my StoryGraph<sup>5</sup>, so I have at least an inkling of what I’m talking about. She’s an amazing writer; you should buy it when it’s published!</p>
<p>My daughter is rapidly turning into the most fiery and powerful person I could have ever hoped she would be. It’s exhausting and enthralling and I’m so freaking happy to be her dad.</p>
<p>We did, in fact, solve some of the flooding problems around our house<sup>6</sup>. We had extensive work done on the back and front yards, and I can proudly say that our front yard is virtually problem-free and our backyard is… better. Obviously there’s more to be done, but in exchange for a lot of money there was a good amount of progress toward eliminating the literal rivers that swirl around our house during a downpour.</p>
<p>For all my breathless pearl-clutching around my running failures, 2022 was, by any reasonable measure, an improvement over 2021, and those improvements should be celebrated… even if they aren’t the <em>impossible gains</em> I wanted.</p>
<p>Strava has a fitness estimate tracker; it’s obscenely biased in ways I can’t begin to wrap my head around, but it seems like a moderate-to-low variance estimator, so it provides a decent relative intuition on fitness over time. And I have to say: given my 2022, it’s halfway ok.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Yeah, my fitness hasn’t been great the past 6 months, but it’s held relatively steady. Given 2022, that’s an accomplishment by itself.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Speaking of running, my total mileage improved year-over-year. I also ran my first half marathon since before COVID<sup>7</sup>. It was the slowest half I’ve ever run (by a lot), but I finished. I also ran a handful of other races last year, which helped remind me that racing is a lot of fun–which helped remind me that <em>running is a lot of fun</em>.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Year-over-year total mileage run. More mileage with fewer runs indicate longer runs.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I spun up an entire Mastodon instance, <a href="https://quinnwitz.house/">Casa Quinnwitz</a>, on my homelab Raspberry Pi cluster (shout-out to the Mastodon dev team, which is full of super kind and patient folks). It’s pretty much my new socialz home, since Twitter has been rendered all-but-unusable with Tweetbot and all the other third-party clients going belly-up. I kind of love the vibe there; feels very longer-form-proto-Twitter with a pre-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September">Eternal September</a> thing going.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup></p>
</section>
<section id="whats-next" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>
<p>I’m back in the academy this semester, teaching my <a href="https://dsp-uga.github.io/sp23">data science practicum</a> course while guiding a half dozen of my remaining students to graduation in May. I have a weekly structure in place that balances my obligations to the academy with my needs for continuing rest, exercise, and <em>my own fun shit</em>. I’m still feeling the after-effects of COVID but am hoping that will taper off as I get back into running again, training for a half marathon in April and multiple shorter races before then. I have a concrete exit strategy from academy, and a timeline of events and milestones to accompany it.</p>
<p>Crucially, I’ve also adopted a new strategy for handling work-related items coming my way: <strong><em>NO</em></strong>.</p>
<p>No, I’m not taking new students.</p>
<p>No, I can’t review for your conference/study section/journal.</p>
<p>No, I’m not open to new research collaborations.</p>
<p>No, I can’t sit on your [insert topic here] panel<sup>9</sup>.</p>
<p>No, I’m not going to be on that committee.</p>
<p>No no no no no. No.</p>
<p>It’s a really hard fucking thing for a lifetime people-pleaser to set up boundaries, but for me in this moment, it’s both a matter of mere survival as well as a pathway to doing what I <em>really</em> love.</p>
<p>Here’s to a 2023 of healing. Much love to all of you 🥂</p>

<p>Why hello there. You may have noticed that things look a little bit different around here.</p>
<p>I’m in the process of migrating my blog <em>off</em> <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> and <em>on</em> to <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>.</p>
<p>Why, you ask? Honestly, I got tired of having to fix a broken plugin or failed <code>git push</code> <em>every. single. time.</em> that I finished writing out a blog post. It gave an already-infrequent task an even higher activation threshold, and during a stretch where spare bandwidth was an incredible luxury.</p>
<p>In short: I’d really like to blog more often, and from what I’ve seen, Quarto will help me do just that. It definitely requires some extra bandwidth to get things migrated over, but fortunately: I have some of that at the moment :)</p>
<p>Stay tuned! In the meantime, please enjoy the above recent photo of Clover helping us put up our tree.</p>

  <title>Fiddling with generative art models</title>
  <dc:creator>Shannon Quinn</dc:creator>
  <link>https://magsol.github.io/posts/2022-08-03-fiddling-with-generative-art/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2022-08-03-fiddling-with-generative-art/starfield.png" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Generated with the text: `4K, wide angle, hyper detailed, starfield, nighttime sky, crescent moons, stars, nebulae, cosmic` by MidjourneyAI."></p>
<p>Much like a lot of the internet over the past couple months, I’ve been tinkering with some AI art generators, mainly <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/">Midjourney</a> (if only because I’m waitlisted on <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALL-E 2</a>).</p>
<p>It’s been surprisingly fun, if challenging. This isn’t really my area of research, but I understand the basic underpinnings:</p>
<p>These models are trained using vast swaths of image-and-text pairings, so the model can develop an association between features in images and the corresponding text that describes them. Obviously this process is <em>very</em> complicated, and also requires not only a great deal of data but also a considerable amount of computing power, so it’s still a very active area of research and is largely out of reach of your every day researcher or individual training their own model. But once the model is trained, users can provide snippets of text, which the model then translates into an image.</p>
<p>Therein lies the magic. There’s a lot of randomness involved in the image generation process, since even a text input as simple as “cat” could mean a LOT of different things, image-wise. That’s partly a feature: two people who give the exact same text input will likely get slight variations of the same concept, and possibly get wildly divergent results.</p>
<p>But it also makes for a challenging user experience: there’s a sort of “lingo” that you have to wrap your head around, a “way of talking to the model” that goes beyond simple word-concept mappings, that only comes with extended use of the models. It gets harder the more specific of an idea you have: your conceptual understanding of the idea may not bear any resemblance to the concept the model learned!</p>
<p>(man this is getting philosophical! let’s see if I can make this a bit more concrete with some examples)</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>This was actually an image that I generated based off an image <em>someone else had already generated</em> (yeah, we can take public images and run them back through the model with new or additional text).</p>
<p>From here, I ran a couple more of my own modifications:</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2022-08-03-fiddling-with-generative-art/empty_beach_v2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Generated by MidjourneyAI."></p>

<p>I really liked the second one, though with the third I love the ambiguity in the landscape: is it water, or is it snow? Hard to say in that lighting.</p>
<p>From here, I started focusing a bit more on landscapes under a starlit sky (like the cover photo). I eventually settled on this one, which I really kinda love (so I made the highest-res version of it that I could):</p>

<p>I will say, it definitely takes some doing to get a feel for how it works–what I had in mind was nowhere near what the model spat out, even though I <em>love</em> what it created. Still, there weren’t really any planetary rings (I was thinking of Gaal’s homeworld in the AppleTV+ <em>Foundation</em> series), and the “glowing small town in a valley” seems to have been diffusely spread over the <em>entire</em> valley, almost like fireflies, rather than distinct. Beautiful, no question, but not exactly what I’d had in mind.</p>
<p>One final bit I tried before my trial ran out was a completely different direction:</p>

</div>
<p>I see a lot of super awesome art being generated from very terse prompts, so I was trying to capture that a little bit here (as opposed to the downright locquacious landscape prompts above).</p>
<p>Some of the earlier images I created had more to do with my family. This first one was created shortly after my wife left her previous job to pursue her longtime dream of being a full-time fiction writer (it was seriously one of the first things I ever learned about her all those years ago): I was inspired to see if the model could capture something about what that looked like, in my head at least.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Generated with the text: <code>a writer working at her computer surrounded by a world of her own creation</code></figcaption>

</div>
<p>And I really love this next one, as it evokes less of the specific act of writing and more of how it’s about <em>creating</em>.</p>

<p>We’ve also been huge fans of Zelda for quite awhile (which <a href="https://magsol.github.io/tag/zelda.html">longtime readers already know</a>), and not too long ago I commissioned a fan account to remake a family photo as if it were in the Zelda universe.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Quite the handsome family, doncha think?</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>So I played with that idea a bit, and while the results weren’t great–I get the feeling the generator has a harder time dealing with <em>very specific real-world concepts</em>, as opposed to more general categories of things–I did get this pretty cute rendering of what is most definitely a Hyrulean family.</p>

<p>It’s fun to tinker with. In all honesty I’ll probably keep playing with it here and there as the mood strikes; if you want to follow along, <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/app/users/730084120558043179/">there’s a public feed of all the pictures I generate here</a> (note: it’s “public” in that you have to create a free account to see it), since there’s no way I’m going to shell out the $ required to make my images private.</p>
<section id="legal-disclaimer" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="legal-disclaimer">Legal Disclaimer</h3>
<p>At least, I’ll keep tinkering until copyright catches up… which, on that note, I should mention: I agree with everything in this twitter thread on the topic. I want to end on this note, because I think this is very important to keep in mind.</p>
<p></p><div id="tweet-27009"></div><script>tweet={"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BunchesOfBees\/status\/1553079149232734208","author_name":"Christopher","author_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BunchesOfBees","html":"\u003Cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" align=\"center\"\u003E\u003Cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003EA thing that makes me absolutely insane with discussions about &quot;AI&quot; image generation is their creators freely argue literally both sides of an opposing argument depending on what argument you&#39;re trying to have with them\u003C\/p\u003E&mdash; Christopher (@BunchesOfBees) \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BunchesOfBees\/status\/1553079149232734208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003EJuly 29, 2022\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cscript async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003E\n","width":550,"height":null,"type":"rich","cache_age":"3153600000","provider_name":"Twitter","provider_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com","version":"1.0"};document.getElementById("tweet-27009").innerHTML = tweet["html"];</script><p></p>
<p>Keep in mind, I am not a lawyer, but based on my read there are two legal interpretations of these models: as an <em>author</em> that learns and creates novel work, or a <em>product</em> that synthesizes derivative works. In the case of the former, any kind of substantive duplication of existing work created by someone else is copyright infringement; and in the case of the latter, it’s using novel, <em>unlicensed</em> work in a paid product, which is also copyright infringement.</p>
<p>As someone whose background is in exactly this kind of generative “AI” work, I would generally fall under the latter interpretation of these models as a product (what they “learn” is dubious at best; I would never call their reproductions “novel”). As such, I also agree with the tweet’s author that the moment these companies begin monetizing these models is when, at the very least, they’ve committed a moral rights violation. It’s the same exact reason I’m very uncomfortable with the <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">GitHub CoPilot product</a>: it’s been trained using billions of lines of code that was written, tested, debugged, scrutinized, and labored over by humans <em>who did not consent to nor were reimbursed for having their code used in a paid product</em>.</p>
<p>That last tweet in the thread is particularly poignant for me, and distills much of the reason for my disillusionment with the tech sector in general. I’m sorry to end on such a sour note, but while I do love the amazing things machine learning is doing, we have to keep at the forefront of our minds that <a href="https://vicki.substack.com/p/neural-nets-are-just-people-all-the">machine learning is, ultimately, a human endeavor</a>, and if it won’t work without humans, we should make sure those humans are <em>taken care of</em>: recognition, compensation, empathy, and so on.</p>
<p><em>steps off soap box…for now</em></p>

<p>I’m not sure where I should even start. How does one sum up a year that felt more like a decade? How does one reflect on a year that eschewed reflection in favor of mere survival?</p>
<p>I want to be the eternal optimist who always sees the silver lining, who always takes away something positive from a negative experience. But to paraphrase (because I can’t find it) someone far more clever than I on Twitter: it feels a bit like trying to find the bright side of things while actively being run over by a zamboni.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose one way would be to try and end this post on a positive note. So to that end, I’ll start with the stuff that sucked in 2021.</p>
<section id="the-bad" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>
<p>Where do I even start? The pandemic continued to rage–Alpha, Delta, and Omicron right at the cusp of the new year–and elected leaders around the globe shrugged their collective shoulders, as if saying “we tried nothing and it didn’t work, so I guess that’s it.”</p>
<p>University of Georgia, in lockstep with the Georgia Board of Regents and many other public universities across the country, collectively threw up their hands, hid behind the malevolent cowardice of our elected leaders, and did all of jack and shit to protect any of the hundreds of thousands of dedicated public service workers who have given 140% of themselves to the institution of higher learning since time immemorial. They continued to fart out meaningless platitudes about “rallying together” whenever another surge arrived but refused to take any meaningful or substantive actions recommended by public health experts the world over–like requiring masks or vaccinations–and instead demanded more of already overtaxed, underpaid janitorial staff to do more pointless bullshit like installing platic dividers or cleaning surfaces forty times a day.</p>
<p>Running has continued to be an elusive outlet for stress. Every run feels hard, and more often than not I’m inclined to not run. Which doesn’t do anything to help my mood, but that vicious negative feedback loop continues nonetheless. I hate it but I’m not sure how to break out of it.</p>
<p>Other shit that sucked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our bun Clover had a bout of GI stasis in the early part of the year. Thankfully, the folks at the UGA Vet Hospital were amazing in getting her well again. Still, scary as shit.</li>
<li>the weather (75F on Christmas? fucking really?)</li>
<li>teaching (and I hate that I hated it, but I’m so, so burned out)</li>
<li>literally the Georgia Board of Regents</li>
<li>annual grant reports (best I can describe is we’re running in place)</li>
<li>burnout in general</li>
<li>mental health in general</li>
<li>every day being a series of bad choices made from a list of exclusively bad choices</li>
</ul>

<p>Somehow, through the grace of God and possibly every deity in the multiverse, we have not tested positive for COVID (<em>knocks on wood</em>).</p>

<p>I took my first flight since Dec 2019 to Washington, D.C., for a workshop hosted at George Washington University on teaching with open source technology. It was a <em>blast</em>. Not only was it an absolute pleasure to spend a few days with some of my professional heroes, folks I’ve known for years through Twitter and who share my same passion for open source technology and innovative instrucitonal methods, but it was great just going to a meeting again!</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2022-01-05-what-the-f-is-this-s/dc-workshop.jpg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Group photo from the GW workshop event. Importantly: everyone is wearing a mask!"></p>
<p>Traveling was the strangest thing, both familiar and foreign. Of course I was a nervous wreck going through the airport, but I commend everyone at GWU for taking every precaution, including mandating the use of masks indoors. It was also the first time either one of us single-parented for more than a few hours at a time, and Cathryn did amazingly well! She even managed Z’s weekly bath ON HER OWN.</p>

<p>I was tenured and promoted. Indeed, I somehow won the cosmic coin flip. I am now an Associate (“ass o’ shit”, in the technical parlance) Professor of Computer Science and Cellular Biology.</p>

<p>We bought a second car (named “Mipha”), a Honda CRV Hybrid, in the summer. We had assumed we’d need two cars, what with our jobs requiring slightly different hours and wildly different physical locations, it would entail too much logistical square dancing for a single car when daycare pickup / dropoff was added to the mix. Of course, then I taught the fall semester almost entirely remotely because of the Delta surge. Still, it’s been really nice to have a bit more room, and our handful of trips to the mountains with Z would absolutely NOT have been possible with Sam (our Honda Accord Hybrid). Not crazy about the added car insurance, though.</p>
<p>Over Christmas, we managed a trip to Arizona (which, in hindset, we may not have done given Omicron) for a family reunion on Cathryn’s side to celebrate her grandfather’s 101st birthday. It was also the first time Z had ever met the family on Cathryn’s side, and the first time she got to meet her great-grandfather, born a <em>century</em> earlier. We took rapid tests every day, and got PCR tested before and after, and <em>somehow</em> only 1 person in the entire extended family got COVID. It was also the first time Z traveled by airplane, and she was amazing. It was lovely. Exhausting, but lovely.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Rain. All day. In the desert. Yeah, global warming’s a myth.</figcaption>

</div>
<p>Other stuff that was neat and definitely didn’t suck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our house won our HOA’s First Place for holiday decorations, specifically in the “whimsical” category! I’m thinking our 7-foot inflatable menorah had something to do with it.</li>
<li>Both Cathryn and I hired running coaches to help us get back into the swing of things. Baby steps!</li>
<li>I was offered–and accepted–a position with <a href="https://quansight.com">Quansight as Principal Solution Architect</a>. I’ll have a <em>lot</em> more to say about this in a later post.</li>
<li>Bathroom renovations are scheduled, and office renovations are being planned. All that’s left in the Priority A category is to address the outdoor flooding.</li>
<li>We managed a handful of mountain trips with Z, and even one with our friend Laura. Z loooves the outdoors, which is awesome.</li>
<li>I got this blog working again!</li>
<li><em>Age of Calamity</em>’s two expansion packs are fun as hell.</li>
<li>Z is just… the singularity of joy in our lives.</li>

<p>It’s cathartic to get all this out in some form. And, of course, there are innumerable positives (and negatives) that I’m forgetting / suppressing / ignoring. I will say this:</p>
<p>I’m genuinely excited for 2022. There’s an insane amount of uncertainty and dread and fear, but there are some changes in store for which I’m really and truly stoked. I just have to hope.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2021-12-30-back-in-action/https:/c.tenor.com/ZFc20z8DItkAAAAd/facepalm-really.gif" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Facepalm gif meme from The Office."></p>
<p>It’s been a day/week/month/year/decade, this 2021.</p>
<p>I apologize for my long silence. Turns out, there are a couple of Pelican plugins that neither play nice with each other, nor with the steady march of upgraded Jupyter components.</p>
<p>Turns out, two plugins I rely on–<a href="https://github.com/pelican-plugins/liquid-tags">liquid-tags</a> and <a href="https://github.com/danielfrg/pelican-jupyter">pelican-jupyter</a>–tend to nuke one another when used in parallel. Not surprising, given they both use the exact same underlying registration protocol for adding new liquid tags, so I guess the real mystery is how these two <em>ever</em> worked at all!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I found that I <em>either</em> have Jupyter notebooks render in all their code-by-text-by-figures beauty, <em>or</em> embed images and videos. Couldn’t have both. After doing some searching and getting the distinct feeling that no one else really cared about the situation, I briefly considered switching static blog devices before regaining a shred of sanity and taking a second look: after all, since both plugins were using the same backend, surely I could jury-rig a solution where I smashed the two together and forced them to play nice?</p>
<p>Turns out, that’s pretty much what I did, but <a href="https://github.com/danielfrg/pelican-jupyter/issues/126#issuecomment-1003171465">with a crucial assist</a> from the maintainer of the pelican-jupyter plugin. There’s an extra config I needed to suppress some of the more problematic CSS from the Jupyter notebooks (this fixed a very strange template error I was getting when compiling the blog), but I still needed a kludge to get the two plugins to even cooperate.</p>
<p>I figured out that by copying two files from the pelican-jupyter plugin over to the liquid-tags plugin–specifically, <code>core.py</code> and <code>liquid.py</code> (though <code>liquid.py</code> had to be renamed to <code>notebook.py</code> after the move)–I could essentially merge the two plugins into one. I did have to make some changes to the <code>liquid.py</code>/<code>notebook.py</code> imports at the top, so they looked like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;

background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">import</span> LiquidTags</span></code></pre></div>
<p>so that they referenced the <em>local</em> versions of <code>liquid_tags.py</code> and <code>mdx_liquid_tags.py</code> (as they were essentially identical to the ones provided by the pelican-jupyter plugin).</p>
<p>Beyond that, the relevant portions of my <code>pelicanconf.py</code> now looked like this:</p>

<p>It’s a bit odd, since I technically do have the pelican-jupyter plugin installed, but I haven’t imported it. Instead, I basically smashed it into the liquid-tags plugin, overwriting the “notebook” tag that was already there (it’s old, it sucks) and running with it.</p>
<p>So yeah! I’m back up and running. Have LOADS to talk about, so stick around!</p>

<p>I get it, I do. And I respect it. But I’m gonna air me some grievances. My therapist has continued to insist that I do what I need and not to feel guilty about it, and right now I need to air some <em>fucking</em> grievances. So strap in folks; here we go.</p>
<p>Running has been a sick joke for most of this year. I’ve been logging miles with some kind of GPS watch since mid-2011, and 2020 has been the lowest-mileage year by a massive margin. For comparison, long-time readers may remember the boondoggles of 2015-2016 when I had metatarsalgia in my feet. Both those years, I still managed to tip the 1,000-mile scale. This year? <strong>711 miles</strong>. Fuck that shit. Running wasn’t an escape; it was a fucking trap of preferring the evil I knew over the evil I didn’t.</p>
<p>Of course, halting my running didn’t help much, either. I was still exhausted beyond all measures, and not just physically: mentally, emotionally, and grammatically <em>burned. out.</em> I managed a couple of walks most days, largely amounting to 10,000 steps or thereabouts, so I guess I met the minimum recommended daily physical activity threshold for the most part. But boy did running leave me stuck with the bill this year.</p>
<p>On the note of bills, let’s talk about how much help we’ve gotten in that area, shall we? As in, fucking none? We’d have gotten more tangible pandemic assistance if we’d wholesale replaced our Georgia state and US federal governments with fucking nail salons, as opposed to the leadership vacuums from Kemp, Congress, and the White House. Jesus goddamn tap-dancing Christ. Frank Underwood in <em>House of Cards</em> killed people, but he got things done in the process. These Republicans just… kill people; whether it’s because of willful incompetence or callous indifference I can’t say, but holy shit: literal poop-flinging monkeys could have accomplished more in their steads. You have to put forth actual effort to be <em>this fucking ineffective</em>. You wanted individualistic self-sufficiency? Well, this is what it looks like, fuckers: if you’ve already got money, you’re fine. If not, welp.</p>
<p>I’ve felt a real kinship these past several months with Jeff Daniels’ Will McAvoy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTjMqda19wk">particularly as he picks apart this fantasy of America being the “greatest country in the world.”</a> What the fuck does that even mean? That we lead the world in COVID cases and deaths? That we’re so star-spangled awesome that anyone with an internet connection can be an armchair epidemiologist? That some so-called moderates are so concerned with curating their centrist appearance that they completely lose sight of the fact that not all (or even most) issues have two sides? That an entire political spectrum in this country has managed to openly flirt with becoming the very thing we fought a war against barely a century ago? That we’re so worried about giving anyone slightly more than they “deserve” that we’ll decimate public institutions, neglect infrastructure, and reinforce existing inequities, so that only the people who already had money will succeed? Are we really this collectively fucking stupid?</p>
<p>Twitter is a fucking nazi cesspool. Facebook is even worse, and Amazon takes the cake for most unethical CEO. Google isn’t innocent, either: I’ve lost any respect I had for my former employer after they fired Timnit Gebru. Then I lost respect for luminaries like Jeff Dean after he doubled-down on some shady post-hoc justification that simultaneously made no sense and also revealed that Google has no collective interest in addressing its structural issues. Then, I lost respect for a number of current Googlers whose work I’ve admired over the years of following them since graduate school when they kept quiet over this whole thing. Meanwhile, Google is being hammered in EU antitrust courts and I frankly couldn’t be happier about it. I hope Facebook gets splintered into dozens of tiny pieces.</p>
<p>Can I just say again–people who selectively listen to experts or “experts” because they confirm what said people already believed can go jump in this fire.</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2020-12-30-festivus-for-the-restivus/diaf.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="A classic 'die in a fire' meme."></p>
<p>Sex work is work, and <em>The West Wing</em> really got this one wrong. Donna, in fact, had it right.</p>
<p><em>Sex and the City</em>, for as much as it may have been ahead of its time in general, is super problematic around trans and nonbinary folks.</p>
<p>I have to divorce J.K. Rowling the person from the author of the <em>Harry Potter</em> books, because she is doing literally everything possible to shit all over what is left of her legacy. I don’t know what her problem with trans people is, or why she’s so threatened by them, but she can likewise join the aforementioned people who listen only to the “experts” they already agree with.</p>
<p>Brandon Sanderson doesn’t write books nearly fast enough.</p>
<p>James S.A. Corey doesn’t write books nearly fast enough.</p>
<p>Patrick Rothfuss doesn’t write books nearly fast enough.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, a massive <strong>FUCK YOU</strong> to the folks I’ve been seeing on Instagram who don’t seem to realize COVID is a thing? Who keep gathering with more people than could possibly be in their pods? Who post pictures of themselves at gyms, bars, restaurants, group runs, and family gatherings for the holidays? They truly are the fuckwads from high school and college who would go off and party instead of working on the team project, difference being that when they invariably came back for the presentation, they’ll end up spontaneously combusting and killing both themselves, their teammates, and half their classmates. I’ve been aggressively un-following these dipshits because if they can’t think about anyone other than themselves in the midst of a global pandemic, why would I want to associate with them when the stakes are eventually more mundane? There are a lot of folks who’ve shown me exactly who they are during this pandemic and they’re not anyone I care to know once COVID is done.</p>
<p>SERIOUSLY. A MODICUM OF LEADERSHIP WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THOUSANDS OF NEEDLESS DEATHS, YOU STAR SPANGLED CESSPOOLS.</p>
<p>Telecommunications in the United States is a fucking travesty. In any other [western] country there are dozens of companies in close competition with one another. Here, we have what amounts to local monopolies on broadband, and an effective duopoly on cell providers. And this gets passed off as “innovation”? Our telecom industry is 20 years behind the rest of the world!</p>
<p>The Georgia Board of Regents: Governor Kemp’s cronies, or just that fucking incompetent? They couldn’t be bothered to implement a mask mandate back at the start of the first COVID surge until the entire university system was practically in a state of open rebellion. Rumor has it there’s really only a couple bad apples among them, but–in much the same vein as the United States Senate–the fact that a single moronic board member can bring everything to a screeching halt is a bug, not a feature. Ted Cruz can bring the Senate to its knees simply by virtue of his vapid tripe; he doesn’t also need a legal basis for his subversion of democracy.</p>
<p>Wear. A. Goddamn. Mask. <em>Fuck.</em></p>
<p>When did it become a feature of a functioning democracy to allow a <a href="https://twitter.com/rmayemsinger/status/1343978502551310337">decaying Confederate monument from Kentucky</a> to singlehandedly decide the fate of any and all legislation that made its way to the US Senate?</p>
<p>Perhaps the single biggest driver of my growing cynicism has been not the pathetic ineptitudes of our government leaders or even the disinformation being sown by talking heads making untold millions of dollars, but instead the seemingly smart, incisive, and compassionate individuals I knew before the pandemic (or even before the election of Trump) who have since turned into people I no longer recognize. Of course I realize the “change” was, in fact, there all along–it is only my perception that has changed. But it has been truly disheartening and enraging to see acquaintances, friends, and even family here in Athens and elsewhere in the United States who forward along conspiracy theories, repeat hate-filled talking points, and play the role of armchair epidemiologists in magnifying misleading or outright false information around COVID-19. From claiming that supplements can reduce severity of COVID symptoms, to somehow dismissing US oubreak numbers by equating them with China, and since “China’s numbers are fudged” therefore the US is doing just fine, to demonizing and even threatening the livelihood of health care workers for the crime of doing their jobs, to giving Trump credit for the rollout of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, to <strong>continuing to push back against and ignoring the advice of actual medical and public health experts</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2020-12-30-festivus-for-the-restivus/dumb.png" class="img-fluid" alt="A screenshot of one of the dumbest tweets ever posted: someone arguing the problem with president #45 was too much power in the Presidency, ceded over years and years."></p>
<p>Seems reasonable, right? Until you include the surrounding context: this person initially claimed Trump should take credit for “Operation Warp Speed,” followed by a hand-waving rationalization of the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/29/politics/vaccine-rollout-behind-schedule/index.html">slow</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/12/29/covid-19-vaccine-distribution-slow-testing/">vaccine</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/current-rate-it-ll-be-10-years-americans-adequately-vaccinated-n1252486">rollout</a> by blaming supply chain hiccups that come with large-scale product manufacturing. Ignoring, of course, that a vaccine has literally been the single goal of the entire US public health sector since January 2020; how the infrastructure for such a rollout wasn’t in place by the summer is a sin worthy of excommunication. But rather than admit as much, we get the above response.</p>
<p>It’s <strong>infuriating</strong> that we can’t just let the experts do their fucking jobs; instead, we have to stake out some pointless fucking pseudo-centrist landscape that doesn’t exist, for the purpose of… what? Appealing to the better demons of both sides? That would be reasonable, except for the small problem of one side being a highly imperfect conglomerate of diverse and often conflicting viewpoints, and the other side being a militaristic theocrat’s wet dream. But sure, states’ rights and framers’ intent and all that.</p>
<p>Oh, that reminds me: I am fucking DONE with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Originalism">originalism</a> (yes, that goes for the Bible too). There is no 21st-century world in which the intentions of 18th century slaveholders would be remotely interesting, worth considering, or at all relevant. Much like how <a href="https://xkcd.com/1357/">an argument of free speech is effectively a concession</a>, an argument of framers’ intent is likewise an indication that your argument stands on the rhetorical equivalent of a sinkhole; continuing to scream “bUt ThE fRaMeRs!” only reveals your partisan / intellectual / insert motivated reasoning hackery here.</p>

<p>Oh, one final grievance. With all due respect to Bill Watterson: <a href="https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/05/11">excessively positive people</a>. In fact, we’ve even come up with a name for this: toxic positivity. Emphasizing the positive in a given situation, <strong>with the unstated assumption</strong> that said positives entirely cancel out all negatives. It’s been coming up a lot in the context of the pandemic: “well the pandemic has been bad but at least I haven’t had to see my boss as much!”, as if the two things were even remotely on the same playing field. Granted, it’s a specific incarnation of the more general ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE mantra, but it’s important to understand that, as complex human beings, we are capable of holding <em>more than one truth</em> in our heads simultaneously.</p>
<p>2020 is both the year Z entered our lives, and it can also die in a fucking fire. Both are true.</p>

<p>Well, this has certainly been a <strong>unique</strong> past couple of months. I had a lot of things in mind for the spring 2020 semester and beyond, but I can safely say it’s all been completely upended now.</p>
<p>I don’t want to trivialize COVID-19 to the suburban equivalent of “can’t go to the community pool for a few months because of a particularly bad case of the fiery poops;” there are real people whose livelihoods are suffering: financially, professionally, and literally, and I think the world as a whole would be a lot better off if we collectively recognized that and pitched in to help.</p>
<p>The Lady and I have been establishing new habits and routines, while trying to maintain a semblance of normality during the pandemic. There have been a lot of snacks (peanut butter M&amp;Ms, cookie dough ice cream, hint of lime chips, and of course, Lucky Charms cereal), some creativity in workplace setup (moved an extra computer monitor from upstairs, and set up a surge protector behind the dining table–also had to line one end of the table with aluminum foil, because our cat kept jumping up on the table from that side), and digging out some old mainstays.</p>
<section id="classics-never-go-out-of-style" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="classics-never-go-out-of-style">Classics Never Go Out of Style</h3>
<p>Early on in the lockdown, The Lady and I kicked off a Zelda-thon, starting with <em>Skyward Sword</em> on the Nintendo Wii. There’s a strange story there: I’d purchased the game for her way back when we lived in separate apartments in Pittsburgh, because she was the Zelda fan between the two of us. Yeah, I’m a gamer, but she’s a <em>Zelda</em> gamer. It was a lot of fun to watch her play the game, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cbwq8ev-EXA">I occasionally jumped in when she needed to tap out</a>. But after reaching the penultimate boss, we just… stopped playing.</p>
<p>For <em>eight years</em>. We knew this, because when we fired up the game again on the weekend of March 14, we saw the last save file pop up for March 28, 2012. Almost eight years <em>to the day</em>.</p>
<p>Since The Lady played most of the game eight years ago, I ended up “driving” this time around. She jumped in whenever she wanted, but we ended up tearing through the game in <strong>10 days</strong>. It was pretty impressive, and it was great to finally see the end of the game that has been referenced SO MUCH in theory videos around <em>Breath of the Wild</em> (which we’ll get to!).</p>
<p>Once we knocked out <em>Skyward Sword</em>, The Lady took the driver’s seat for <em>Twilight Princess</em>. I’d never seen the game played start to finish, and had really never seen anything beyond the quests involving collecting light shards (which is, as I discovered, a meager portion of the game’s introduction). Suffice to say, this one took a lot longer; most of the month of April, if memory serves.</p>
<p>After that, I took a deep breath and fired up <em>Breath of the Wild</em>… in <strong>Master Mode</strong>. Yes, <a href="https://magsol.github.io/2019-08-12-breath-of-the-wild">I’ve posted about this game here before</a>, and we ended up beating it sometime in November 2019. But the DLC included an evil modification called “Master Mode”, which among other terrible things, has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every enemy in the game is upgraded by one level (red become blue, blue become brown, brown become silver, silver become <a href="https://cdn.gamer-network.net/2017/usgamer/Breath-of-the-Wild-DLC-Guide-header.jpg/EG11/thumbnail/1920x1080/format/jpg/quality/65/18-12-2018-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-dlc-everything-we-know.jpg">gold</a>, a brand-new level)</li>
<li>Enemies heal when they’ve been out of combat for two seconds (not hyperbole; literally two seconds)</li>
<li>Brand-new <a href="https://imgix.bustle.com/mic/knzgpkctoycksfpvki9e3kuc7fozfcugpfqn63lps6nee90vzthnydlbjtvt26lx.jpg?w=1020&amp;h=576&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;cs=srgb&amp;q=70">floating platforms</a> with enemies, because fuck you that’s why</li>
</ul>
<p>It is <em>brutal</em>, especially in the first quarter of the game. You end up skipping fights by default, sneaking around a lot more, and fighting as though you cannot take a single hit (because in all likelihood, you can’t). I haven’t finished it yet, but just this past weekend we completed the last of the DLC “Ballad of the Champions,” so really the only thing left of the Main Quests is to destroy Calamity Ganon.</p>
<p>Once this is done, The Lady plans to break out the game that really and truly started it all: <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, which I’ve also never seen played start to finish, so that will be fun to watch!</p>
<p>On a completely separate video gaming front, I managed to get a Stargate mod working for <em>Sins of a Solar Empire</em>, and even started playing a small 1v1 as the Ancients against the Wraith. It looks incredible!</p>

<p>I can’t wait to explore some of the other races–Asgard, Goa’uld, and Ori round out the playable races, while a recent update includes some “minor factions” that are always AI-controlled but can still change the dynamics of play: Tau’ri (that’s us!), Free Jaffa, Vanir (rogue Asgard offshoot seen in <em>Atlantis</em>), and Michael’s Hybrids.</p>

<p>While The Lady and I have been re-visiting the classics to keep us grounded, we’ve also been branching out.</p>
<p>First, like most, we tried our hand at baking sourdough. And, frankly, it turned out incredible!</p>

</div>
<p>We’ve since baked a new recipe of chocolate chip cookies (which <em>mostly</em> turned out chewy), and have plans to whip up some butterscotch bars.</p>
<p>We’ve also been starting up some regular remote get-togethers, from weekly chats with my family to weekly post-run “coffee chats” with some of our running friends. We’ll go out for runs by ourselves, come home, get cleaned up, and FaceTime each other while making coffee and getting ready for the day. We’re also about to try out remote gaming tomorrow with some friends of ours from Pittsburgh–they, like us, are big board gaming geeks. I’m not sure exactly what we’re going to play or how it’ll pan out, but I’m excited to try!</p>
<p>The Lady and I took a page from a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/the-best-board-games-to-play-with-your-quarantined-housemates/">recent list of recommended quarantine board games</a> and purchased <em>Star Realms</em>. Think: a super-simple mash-up of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> and <em>Dominion</em>. It’s a deck-building game with a common “market” of cards you can purchase, and the goal is to use those cards to bludgeon your opponent to death in the most sci-fi manner possible. Meanwhile, I sunk several days in over at <a href="https://www.heroforge.com/">Hero Forge</a> designing avatars for her and me. I think they came out pretty well!</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2020-05-20-working-from-home/heroforge.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="A picture of finished minis from HeroForge."></p>
<p>Speaking of remote activities together, we actually did try our hand at a “remote viewing” of a movie, and it worked remarkably well! Two of our runners friends joined us to watch <em>A League Of Their Own</em>, both because one of them had never seen it before, and because of <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2890923-mary-pratt-last-surviving-rockford-peach-dies-at-age-101">last week’s news that the last of the original Rockford Peaches passed away at 101</a>. We’d originally hoped to use a video synchronization platform like <a href="https://www.netflixparty.com/">Netflix Party</a>, but Netflix doesn’t have <em>A League Of Their Own</em>; Amazon Prime does. So we looked into <a href="https://www.kastapp.co/">Kast</a>, but after 30 minutes of tinkering, it was clear the app is still too young and rough around the edges; we were constantly having either sound or video issues. So we did it the old-fashioned way: fired up a Zoom chat, and counted down to hitting “Play” out loud. And it actually worked quite well! We were never more than 20 seconds off each other.</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2020-05-20-working-from-home/aloto.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="A meme from A League Of Their Own with Tom Hanks yelling 'There's no crying in baseball!'"></p>
<p>Our sudden and constant presence all day every may have caught our pets off guard, but they sure seem to be enjoying it. Zippy is scampering around us, jumping on our laps, and trying to jump on our work table one minute, then is passed out on the couch for hours on end the next. Clover, meanwhile, seems to find a napping spot anywhere she goes, but has started expecting treats at all hours of the day (partly our fault for giving her the occasional piece of banana with breakfast… and piece of fruit or veggie for lunch… and for dinner… ).</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2020-05-20-working-from-home/aminals.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Both our black cat Zippy and white rabbit Clover, sitting on different levels of a pet tree."></p>
<p>One of the biggest changes on my end (besides the obvious, of course), was buying a new laptop. This has been on my list for several months, as my aging MacBook Pro Mid-2014 has been struggling more and more to keep up with workloads. When the new laptop arrived, it took three entire days to fully transfer and configure it just right; I’m still coming across things here and there that need to be fully fleshed out (e.g., screen saver still isn’t the picture collage, and it’s not properly password protected, and the desktop backgrounds don’t switch out, and other small but noticeable things).</p>
<p>But the thing I wasn’t expecting that hit me really hard when it was time to shut down, wipe, and ship out the old laptop was the melancholy.</p>
<p>I’d purchased this old laptop (aptly-named “Apollo”) in September 2014 in the throes of writing my dissertation. I remember it distinctly: sitting in the Squirrel Hill Starbucks, ear pods in, listening to some Pandora station while typing away in the Latex document… when suddenly my ear pods <em>screeeeeched</em>, my screen froze, and moments later, my ear pods went silent and the screen went dark. I rebooted, and… nothing. According to the Apple Geniuses later that evening, the motherboard has inexplicably fried. It was well out of warranty, so my only option was to purchase a brand-new laptop.</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2020-05-20-working-from-home/apollo.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="My old mid-2014 MacBook Pro. RIP."></p>
<p>That was Apollo. It got me through my PhD dissertation and defense, the move to Athens and the start of my tenure-track position at UGA, and through the first five years of it–well into my promotion and tenure process, my first couple of successful grants, and so, so many papers. It was a veritable workhorse of a laptop that, with a little sprucing up, still has some life in it.</p>
<p>Now, I have a laptop that is literal orders of magnitude more powerful than the previous one, yet it has huge shoes to fill. We’ll see if the new laptop–<a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/images/5/52/Dinraal.jpg">Dinraal</a>–is up to the task.</p>

</section>
<section id="whats-next" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>
<p>Not sure, honestly. We’re taking it one day at a time. We’re being kind to each other and ourselves. We’re trying to be safe, not just for us, but for everyone else around us.</p>
<p>Stay safe and happy, my friends.</p>

  <title>Breath of Fresh (albeit, indoor) Air</title>
  <dc:creator>Shannon Quinn</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-08-12-breath-of-the-wild/lakehylia.jpg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Link from Breath of the Wild overlooking the scenery from the vantage point of Lake Hylia."></p>
<p>This is a divergence that is simultaneously strange and entirely predictable.</p>
<p>Allow me to explain.</p>
<p>First and foremost, <a href="https://wherearethepancakes.wordpress.com/2019/08/07/marathon-training-mode-enable/">I’ve been training for my first marathon in 4.5 years for the past several months</a>. It’s largely consisted of <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a20807188/how-do-i-build-a-training-base/">base-building</a>, but in the last couple of weeks we entered the “official” 16-week marathon training period…</p>
<p>…and my knee started pulling. Oh! And it coincided with the first week of decent summer weather we’ve had here in Athens since…2018? And if the past two weeks are any indication, this summer is going to be <a href="https://wherearethepancakes.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/the-summer-doldrums-arent-all-theyre-cracked-up-to-be/">as bad as that brutal one in 2016</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-08-12-breath-of-the-wild/goroncity.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Link from Breath of the Wild speaking with a Goron in Goron City."></p>
<p>Anyway!</p>
<p>Since I noticed the pulling in my knee the week before “official” training was to begin, my coach and I agreed–in the name of being super-cautious this early in the training cycle–that I would take a week off from running, focus on cross-training and physical therapy exercises, and let my knee heal up. During this time, I dove into the 2017 hit <em>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, the new Zelda release for the Nintendo Switch, and logged–to use the technical term–a shitton of hours.</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-08-12-breath-of-the-wild/hillside.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Link from Breath of the Wild standing on a hillside covered in flowers."></p>
<p>Let me back up a little further.</p>
<p>I’ve never been secretive about my love of video gaming (and board gaming, and regular old sportsball gaming… any kind of gaming, really). But my real passion in video games has largely been constrained to variants of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">first-person shooters</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy">real-time strategy</a>. This includes the usual suspects like <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em> and <em>StarCraft II</em>, but also slight variations like <em>Civilization V</em> (haven’t gotten the hang of <em>VI</em> yet), <em>Cities: Skylines</em>, <em>Homeworld</em>, and <em>Sins of a Solar Empire</em>.</p>
<p>The upshot: <em>Zelda</em> has never really been on my radar.</p>
<p>I mean, <strong>of course</strong> I’m familiar with the Zelda franchise. Back in the days of the <a href="https://www.dkoldies.com/game-boy-original-system-nintendo/">OG GameBoy</a>, I played <em>Link’s Awakening</em>. A lot of it. I played through it so many times I eventually figured out how to find enough “secret seashells” to get the Master Sword just before completing the 4th of the 8 main dungeons.</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-08-12-breath-of-the-wild/linksawakening_orig.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Screenshot from Link's Awakening on the original GameBoy unit."></p>
<p>(if it’s possible to get the sword sooner than that, don’t bother, I don’t want to know)</p>
<p>But for those who know the larger Zelda lore, this installment exists awkwardly both within but also without the Zelda story. I mean–SPOILERS for a 20+ year old game SPOILERS–it was all a dream. Or was it instead a reality that existed within our own, but vanished when the Wind Fish woke up? Who knows?</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-08-12-breath-of-the-wild/linksawakening_switch.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="A pair of screenshots comparing the same location in Link's Awakening on the GameBoy version of the game to the recent Switch port."></p>
<p>(apparently there was a Nintendo Switch remake of <em>Link’s Awakening</em>?)</p>
<p>Regardless, while the usual Zelda themes certainly exist in <em>Link’s Awakening</em>, the specific story points don’t. So years later it was a shock to learn that Link actually had a primary antagonist, <strong>Ganon</strong>.</p>
<p>When I first met my future wife, one of the many things about her that charmed me was her love of the <em>Zelda</em> franchise, especially <em>Ocarina of Time</em>. I was never super motivated to play the games myself, but something that seems almost uniquely exclusive to Zelda games: they’re incredibly fun to watch someone else play! Even better, The Lady and I soon discovered that, not only did we have different playstyles when it came to video games, but they complemented each other in a way that really helped her/us solve the puzzles in these games with ruthless efficiency.</p>
<p>But even after watching her crush Ganon in <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, <em>Twilight Princess</em>, and Ganon’s progenitor in <em>Skyward Sword</em> (which I bought her as a gift on the very first Nintendo console we ever owned together… awwwwwww), I still never felt the itch to play the game myself.</p>
<p>And when I likewise bought <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, again for her to play, I once more assumed I’d watch, point things out here and there, and let her Zelda fandom run wild. Plus, I’d seen the reviews of this installment, and knew that while they’d thrown out a lot of “typical” Zelda grind, they also added a bunch of new gaming mechanisms that, on the surface, I held my nose for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breakable weapons: I’d played games where weapons only lasted for finite amounts of time, and <em>holy shit</em> did this mechanic annoy the crap out of me.</li>
<li>Recipes: I haven’t actually played a game with this mechanic, but it’s been showing up more frequently in RPGs, a gaming genre I generally have a very, very hard time getting into.</li>
<li>Seasonality: This encompasses not only night/day changes, but also changes in weather patterns in-game, and subsequent changes in clothing / preparation of countermeasures (food, elixirs) in order to survive. I’ve played a lot of games with the night/day mechanic and have found it “meh” at best, super f*ckin annoying at worst. Combined with the need to constantly swap out clothing to adjust (and potentially lose abilities the previous clothing gave me) was irksome just to think about.</li>
<li>Nonlinear open world: Again, nothing against nonlinear gameplay–I for one love that <em>Civilization</em> has multiple win conditions, and that the <em>StarCraft II</em> missions are built to discourage “turtling” and force you to get creative–but as an avid follower of <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/v2/series/zero-punctuation/">Zero Punctuation</a> I know how “well” Ubisoft’s (for example) “nonlinear” “open world” games have faired, and for the life of me I couldn’t see a game on Zelda’s scope doing any better.</li>
</ul>
<p>Boy oh boy, was I <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-08-12-breath-of-the-wild/lostwoods.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Link from Breath of the Wild standing near a campfire on a tower overlooking the foggy Lost Woods."></p>
<p>I watched The Lady play a game of her own for quite awhile, and at some point just kinda thought: eh, why not? and started my own game.</p>
<p>I was <em>hooked</em>. I can’t even explain why; even while writing that list of grievances, I kept thinking of examples <em>other</em> than <em>Breath of the Wild</em> with those mechanics and getting annoyed all over again. And yet, these are so well-done in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> that I don’t even notice them. Even moreso, annoyances in previous Zelda iterations–the “forced save points” of <em>Skyward Sword</em>, the nails-on-a-chalkboard running-back-and-forth over the <em>Ocarina</em> landscape to finish a simple side quest, the rupee limitations of literally every other <em>Zelda</em> game (until you bought a bigger rupee purse ???), the constant hunt for more arrows, and the lack of any jumping ability–they’re all gone!</p>
<p>The best thing I can say about this game is that they did an incredible job of 1) identifying the annoying things of previous Zelda games and cutting them out, and 2) introducing these new mechanics in a way that felt natural and intuitive. That’s really the crux of it: the game is <em>easy to figure out</em>, even while the actual gameplay is incredibly, brutally, and satisfyingly challenging.</p>
<p>That mastery of basics is why the game scales to such a <em>massive</em> landscape (thank you, travel points!); that’s why there’s enough room for three distinct and gorgeous dragons that fill you with excitement every time their music comes out of nowhere;</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-08-12-breath-of-the-wild/dinraal.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Link from Breath of the Wild looking up at the dragon Dinraal in the sky above."></p>
<p>that’s why staying in the nearest stable during a thunderstorm or going deep into the arctic tundra feels so much like curling up in front of a crackling fire on a freezing cold day;</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-08-12-breath-of-the-wild/snow.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Link from Breath of the Wild standing in a snowstorm with minimal visibility in any direction."></p>
<p>that’s why, even after completing part of a main quest, you’ll find yourself returning over and over to the same points on the map–to see an old friend, find a new side quest, or exchange some shiny rocks you could sell anywhere for a better price but you keep coming here because something about it makes you feel at home;</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-08-12-breath-of-the-wild/zoradomain.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Link from Breath of the Wild standing in the central fountain at Zora's Domain."></p>
<p>that’s why you can take a break in between main quests to try and ride a stag;</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-08-12-breath-of-the-wild/shrinequest.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Link from Breath of the Wild mounted on a stag, both standing on a shrine pedestal."></p>
<p>and yes, this is an actual side quest.</p>
<p>Nintendo knocked this one clear out of the park. It’s so wonderfully and incredibly immersive: I go from exploring the freezing cold peaks of the Hebra mountains to chasing down a monster aficionado with a nighttime shop along the southeastern coastline with absolutely no recollection of how I transitioned from one to the other.</p>
<p>But by far, the single biggest surprise is <strong>the plot</strong>. It’s nuanced, and mysterious, and even chilling in some cases, and it has me on the edge of my seat wanting to know what happens next. Previously, I’ve always felt the plot in Zelda games was a perpetual weakness: Zelda/Link good, Ganon bad, bludgeon Ganon until bad goes away and credits roll. But this game–at least so far (I’m not done yet)–makes me think there’s something at work beyond Ganon and his usual hijinks. The “good guys” in particular don’t seem perfect; I’m being led to think they made mistakes!</p>
<p>Sadly, classes start this week, so it’s unlikely I’ll be making fast progress over the next few months. But I do know The Lady was pretty thrilled to unlock one particular character from previous Zelda games who, while technically present in this game, required some external convincing to join the quest:</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-08-12-breath-of-the-wild/epona.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Link from Breath of the Wild standing in front of Epona, the horse of legend."></p>
<p>I am loving everything about this game. Go buy it and forget reality! It’s a great way to kill time while healing from an injury.</p>

  <title>Quinnwitz in Ireland</title>

<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-06-03-quinnwitz-in-ireland/gapofdunloe.jpg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="The Gap of Dunloe in Killarney, Ireland."></p>
<p>The Lady and I just returned from a 12-day trip to Ireland (with a stop at the very start in Kent, England, to visit some <a href="https://twitter.com/kmorrell04">dear friends</a> and their <a href="./kent.jpg">6-month old</a> twins!).</p>
<p>I can’t begin to describe how incredible the trip was. It was one of those dreams you realize at some point you’ve been discussing with your significant other for <em>years</em>–quips here and there about “wouldn’t it be awesome to visit x” or “when we visit y someday…”. Ireland had been at the top of our list of international locations to see since years before we even got married, but it was always 5-10 years in the future, and never got any closer to reality.</p>
<p>Until that dear friend’s wedding in Bedford, England, in late summer 2017. At some point during some downtime in that long weekend, Ireland came up again in the same way it always did, but whether it was the international setting we were already in or some other twist of fate, The Lady suddenly said: “Let’s set a date.”</p>
<p>That day in August 2017, we set a tentative, but <em>actual</em>, date of May 2019. And we nailed it.</p>
<section id="overview" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The logistics of the trip were pretty complicated. First, we wanted to fly into London and spend a day visiting those friends of ours out in Kent. Next, we wanted to start our journey in Ireland by spending a few days in Dublin.</p>
<p>From there, we wanted to hike in <a href="https://www.wicklowmountainsnationalpark.ie/">Wicklow National Park</a> before spending a few days in Killarney, exploring the <a href="https://ringofkerrytourism.com/">Ring of Kerry</a> (important note: not a “ring” as in a piece of jewelry).</p>
<p>Finally, we wanted to drive to Galway and spend a few days there, before returning to Dublin and flying back home.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr A travel agent will make your life a lot easier when your international travels have a lot of moving parts.</strong></p>

<p>The country was seriously amazing. Ireland is the most incredible combination of different landscapes and ecosystems all coexisting side by side; driving from Dublin to Killarney to Galway and back will show multiple distinct countrysides that change seamlessly yet suddenly.</p>
<p>Without further adieu, I’ll post some of my favorite pictures here from the trip.</p>

<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-01-31-starcraft-ii-questions/do_you_wanna_play_sc2.jpeg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="A meme image of the Frozen song, with the words instead indicating 'Do you want to play Starcraft?'"></p>
<p>I’ve been sick the past couple of days. In between drinking way too much tea, passing out cold, and actually getting the occasional bit of work done, I’ve been (re-)playing a decent amount of <em>StarCraft II</em>, specifically the <em>Legacy of the Void</em> (<em>LotV</em>) campaign. It’s the final installment of SC2, and honestly it’s the one I find most frustrating.</p>
<p>No, it’s not the dialogue, which is <em>super</em> cliche and overwrought, but it’s endemic across the entire SC2 series. Also, the <em>LotV</em> gameplay honestly makes up for it (as is true for most of the SC2 series).</p>
<p>Rather, my problem is with the actual storytelling. There are lots of sprawling story elements but a lot of them just don’t make any sense. <em>Heart of the Swarm</em> (<em>HotS</em>) <a href="https://magsol.wordpress.com/2013/04/01/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm-review/">had a few chin-scratching moments</a>, but overall the storyline was a pretty clear and well-motivated revenge tale. Even before that, <em>Wings of Liberty</em> (<em>WoL</em>) was a clear and compact story of regret and redemption. So while the <em>LotV</em> gameplay was outstanding, it was extremely jarring for the story to be so jumbled and reliant on retconning a large amount of StarCraft lore.</p>
<p>So may I present, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1YuvUQFJ0">inspired by RedLetterMedia’s treatment of <em>Prometheus</em> several years back</a>, a list of questions that came to mind. Presented in no particular order:</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-01-31-starcraft-ii-questions/like_farmville.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="A meme image based on a screenshot from in-game Starcraft, with text reading 'Like Farmville, but with attack function.'"></p>
<ul>
<li>So apparently Emil Narud / Samir Duran was <em>also</em> a fallen Xel’Naga, as he said as much in the <em>LotV</em> epilogue missions. Why was he alive all this time, but not Amon? How did he escape Amon’s fate?</li>
<li>Why did he take the form of a human instead of some all-powerful hybrid like the ones he was cultivating in those years? What was stopping Amon from taking the form of a human as well?</li>
<li>What were the purposes of Duran’s machinations in <em>Brood War</em>? As stated at the time, it was in the service of returning Amon and breeding the hybrid, but if he was a full Xel’Naga, why would Amon’s resurrection even be necessary? Couldn’t Narud just remake all life in the universe, then resurrect Amon at his leisure for their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_End_(film)">post-universe-destruction celebration party</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-01-31-starcraft-ii-questions/siege_tank_rush.gif" class="img-fluid" alt="A meme image of the original Starcraft with a screen filled with siege tanks, and text saying 'Where is your god now?'"></p>
<ul>
<li>Oh man, the <a href="https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Khala">Khala</a>. Supposedly the thing that both saved the Protoss race back in the day, but also nearly led to their destruction when Amon infiltrated it in <em>LotV</em>. A nice symmetry, sure, but… ok. So. The Khala was linked through khaydarin crystals, which are rife throughout Protoss technology. The Protoss themselves interface with it through their nerve cords, which [SPOILER ALERT] they all sever at the end of <em>LotV</em> to drive Amon back into the Void. But couldn’t he just live on in their technology?</li>
<li>Would the Protoss have to derive entirely new, non-khaydarin crystal technology to completely drive out Amon?</li>
<li>How on Kerrigan’s red Char did they manage to sever the nerve cords of literally all the Protoss of the Golden Armada–including those who had not yet arrived at Aiur–in the two minutes that the keystone was able to contain Amon?! <a href="https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Rohana">Rohana</a> proved that physical distance was not an issue for Amon, only connection to the Khala via nerve cords did. How could they have possibly gotten the order out to all those Protoss in such a short period?</li>
<li>Amon is shown leaving Artanis’ body when Zeratul severs his nerve cords. But couldn’t Amon just possess Artanis? Why was Amon able to inhabit the Khala, but not individuals?</li>
<li>I mean, where is the Khala even centralized? If it’s just the psychic connection between Protoss–and therefore completely decentralized–wouldn’t Amon act more like a virus? Why would severing everyone’s nerve cords suddenly leave Amon homeless? Is severing your nerve cords like a vaccination?</li>
<li>Why would Amon even need a “host body” if he’s able to take over literally all the Khalai Protoss?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-01-31-starcraft-ii-questions/nuclear_launch.png" class="img-fluid" alt="A meme image of a cat, with text saying 'Nuclear launch detected.'"></p>
<ul>
<li>How did Amon control the Zerg? Through an Overmind? Where was it located? If not, did he exert control over every individual Zerg? How? Why couldn’t he do the same thing through the Protoss? Or hell, even the Terrans?</li>
<li>Did he possess the Zerg? Why couldn’t he control Kerrigan’s Zerg? Or again, the Protoss?</li>
<li>Where was Amon in the intervening period of <em>Heart of the Swarm</em> when he was (presumably) already revived following the conclusion of <em>Wings of Liberty</em>, but not yet the main villain at beginning of <em>LotV</em>? <a href="https://xkcd.com/712/">Drinking at a bar somewhere</a>?</li>
<li>The original StarCraft lore seems to be retconned to suggest (in no uncertain terms) that any and all tampering in the development of the Zerg and Protoss was the fault of Amon and his followers and <em>not</em> part of the original plan put in motion by the Xel’Naga. Does that mean the Khala was Amon’s creation, as well as the Overmind? What was even supposed to happen absent the Khala or the Overmind?</li>
<li>Why was Amon so much more powerful than Ouros? They’re both Xel’Naga; wouldn’t they be evenly matched?</li>
<li>Kerrigan was Xel’Naga for all of an hour before she flat-out blasted Amon out of existence. How? Why was she better equipped to deal with Amon in such short order, compared to a friendly Xel’Naga trapped in the Void for eons?</li>
<li>Sure, maybe the combined might of both Narud and Amon kept Ouros trapped in the Void, but Narud was only with his master for all of a campaign and a half; plus, it was only <em>after</em> Stukov dealt Narud the killing blow in the epilogue that Ouros began the process of giving Kerrigan his essence. Wouldn’t the combined might of Kerrigan and Ouros be infinitely more powerful than just Amon?</li>
<li>If Amon killed all those slumbering Xel’Naga in Ulnar, why wouldn’t they also just return to the Void, as Amon did at the end of <em>LotV</em>?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-01-31-starcraft-ii-questions/no_patience.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="A meme image showing a siege tank operator in Starcraft II, with text saying 'Claims to have no patience for sitting around, chooses siege tank operator as his profession.'"></p>
<ul>
<li>The Tal’darim are introduced in <em>WoL</em> as a “fanatical” group of Protoss who generally do their own thing. In <em>LotV</em>, it’s revealed that they’re actually in league with Amon. But in <em>WoL</em>, they are <em>actively</em> fighting <em>against</em> the retrieval of the artifact pieces–an essential step to assembling the artifact, using it to de-infest Kerrigan, and capturing all that power to resurrect Amon. This connection becomes even more confusing when considering that it was Moebius Corps who literally hired Jim Raynor and his Raiders to assemble the artifact pieces.</li>
<li>i.e., Moebius Corps was led by Emil Narud, aka Samir Duran, aka <em>the one dude who’s been trying for millennia to resurrect Amon</em>. Why would the Tal’darim fight directly against him? Did it take them the countless ages between the <a href="https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Aeon_of_Strife">Aeon of Strife</a> and <em>HotS</em> to realize they were working for the same guy?</li>
<li>Do the Tal’darim still have their nerve cords? Are they connected to the Khala?</li>
<li>It would seem not, since after Alarak becomes their highlord and turns them against Amon, I would think Amon’s first course of action would be to take control of them, but he doesn’t, or can’t. But it seems like they <em>do</em> have nerve cords, given Alarak’s huge jagged ponytail thing. So are they somehow <em>not</em> connected to the Khala, despite having nerve cords? If that’s the case, why can’t the Daelaam do the same? Is it a <em>choice</em> to connect to the Khala? Is it like the Force–something you can train yourself to use, but which you can also consciously separate yourself from?</li>
<li>Alarak is, like, wicked powerful. <em>Crazy</em> powerful. He breaks through a stasis field on the <em>Spear of Adun</em> like it was tissue paper, and blasts open an armored door and destroys a warp crystal on Aiur with a <em>single shot</em>. Where was that ability when he was fighting Malash for highlord?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-01-31-starcraft-ii-questions/7_marines.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="A meme image showing a Terran Marine, with text reading 'Build 7 marines, lose to 2 zealots.'"></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Nerazim">Nerazim</a> are said to draw their power “from the <a href="https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Void">Void</a>”. What even is the Void? Some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_Universe">parallel evil dimension</a>?</li>
<li>But the Void clearly has toxic and destabilizing effects on the “current” dimension, since anytime a rift opens it pretty much wipes everything it touches apart. But then, in the epilogue, everyone gears up and heads into the Void! How?!</li>
<li>So, the Dark Templar get their power from the same place as the Xel’Naga? And Amon? Wouldn’t that mean only a Dark Templar can defeat Amon? Or that Amon could pierce Nerazim cloaks?</li>
<li>Or, wouldn’t that mean Amon would have total control over their abilities, making them just as vulnerable to his influence as the Khalai Protoss?</li>
<li>Seriously, how are <em>missiles</em> going to be an effective weapon in the Void?</li>
<li>Against Narud and Amon?</li>
<li><em>AMON</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2019-01-31-starcraft-ii-questions/i_got_this.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="A meme image showing a lone Terran Marine standing in front of an Ultralisk, with text reading 'GTFO, I got this.'"></p>
<ul>
<li>Let’s talk a bit about Amon’s “plan”. He wanted to break the <a href="https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_Cycle">Infinite Cycle</a> and remake all life in his image. But the end credits of <em>LotV</em> literally said, that with Kerrigan’s ascension and the alliance’s victory over Amon, the Infinite Cycles came to an end. So… mission accomplished?</li>
<li>So, from the Void, he uses his pawn / follower / fellow Xel’Naga (???) Narud to work on a way to resurrect him, creating “false” hybrid armies in the meantime. Were these hybrid basically accelerated versions of what the Infinite Cycles were supposed to “naturally” result in? I mean, weren’t the Zerg and Protoss ultimately meant to merge?</li>
<li>Amon corrupted the Zerg, creating an overriding imperative to destroy or assimilate the Protoss. Since the Protoss can’t be infested, I would assume that basically amounts to a “kill” order?</li>
<li>Anyway, the Overmind cleverly tries to circumvent that order by creating the Queen of Blades, with supposedly only slightly more free will than it. Why? Where does that slightly-more-free-will come from? Just because she’s Terran, and therefore not a Xel’Naga creation? Or was it something unique to Kerrigan?</li>
<li>Of course, she was only infested <em>after</em> Amon’s death. How was Narud/Duran planning to resurrect his master, then? It was only the <em>de</em>-infestation of Kerrigan that gave him enough power to resurrect Amon. So until that unlikely sequence of infestation-deinfestation events happened, had he just been spending a lot of time on his Pelaton and researching <a href="https://www.tesla.com/powerwall">cutting-edge battery technology</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Really, I just think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX_FxBSEh1A">this game sucks</a>.</p>
<p>(not really tho)</p>
