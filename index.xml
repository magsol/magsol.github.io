<p>Admittedly, this post in the series will be less “here’s how to spin up your own instance” than “here’s why I had so many problems that are specific just to me”, so if you have a solid handle on your own home network topology and/or are a DNS savant, feel free to skip this post.</p>
<p>For the rest of us mere networking mortals, let me walk you through a network hiccup that has been stymieing my attempt at an honest-to-goodness homelab kubernetes cluster for the better part of the last couple years.</p>
<section id="thanks-a-lot-bezos" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thanks-a-lot-bezos">Thanks a lot, Bezos</h3>
<p>During the height of the pandemic in summer 2020–and somewhat in preparation for the birth of our daughter–I performed some long-overdue home network upgrades. This included 1) switching over to fiber internet, and 2) upgrading to a mesh network, rather than the janky router-plus-extender setup that honestly never really worked all that well. The router itself was already 5+ years old (purchased when we first moved into the house), so it needed an upgrade anyway.</p>
<p>At the recommendation of some friends, I went with <a href="https://eero.com/">eero</a>. Honestly, I’d still recommend it: it’s been rock-solid, with no problems between my Apple devices (MBP, iPad Pro, and iPhone), my wife’s Android+Windows devices (Surface, Pixels), and our myriad <a href="https://twitter.com/internetofshit">internet-of-sh!t devices</a> strewn throughout the house. Literally zero problems, which I honestly can’t even say for our old router.</p>
<p>…with, I suppose, one exception: putting the eeros into bridge mode.</p>
</section>
<section id="bridge-mode-is-not-what-you-think-it-is" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bridge-mode-is-not-what-you-think-it-is">Bridge mode is not what you think it is</h3>
<p>As far as I’m aware, across all devices–from ISP modems to VirtualBox to Docker to home routers–the term “bridge mode” has a common intuition: it means the device that has been placed into bridge mode relinquishes any intelligent packet organizing methods it may have been using before and simply acts as a simple “bridge” between whatever entities it is connected to. As such, it doesn’t really care what those entities are, it just passes traffic between them.</p>
<p>Not so with eeros.</p>
<p>To illustrate, here is what my home network looked like <em>before</em> starting any of this craziness.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2023-01-23-mastodon-home-network-topology/original.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="My home network setup pre-Mastodon, where the main eero connects directly to the AT&amp;T modem and acts as the chief router and DHCP server of the household."></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Why yes, I did configure MoCA for my home mesh, thanks for asking.</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This setup worked, except… see that Raspberry Pi cluster in the bottom left? That’s where I installed k3s for tinkering, but “tinkering” is pretty much all anything amounted to, because eeros have an odd limitation when it comes to port forwarding: <strong>they don’t allow IP-based service forwarding</strong>, or at least, service forwarding that is based <strong>solely</strong> on IP addresses; they also require MAC addresses. When dealing with ephemeral services created by kubernetes clusters on floating IP ranges, there aren’t associated MAC addresses with these services, which makes it impossible to use software-based load balancers like <a href="https://metallb.universe.tf/">metallb</a>, and therefore impossible to deploy multiple services that use similar configurations–like, say, multiple websites: Mastodon and something else.</p>
<p>So the first thing I had to do, were I to run my own instance, was to figure out a network configuration that would allow me to do IP-based port forwarding. I recalled that my old router had this ability, so I figured: let’s just pull that out of retirement and use it purely for port forwarding!</p>
<p>Following was my first attempt. Note the major changes: the router has taken the place of the “main” eero as connecting directly to the ISP modem, and what was formerly the “main” eero is now just a wireless access point, connected to nothing <em>except</em> the router.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2023-01-23-mastodon-home-network-topology/first_bridge_attempt.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="My initial attempt at a home network setup that re-integrated my old router which could perform IP-based port forwarding. It took the place of the main eero by connecting to the ISP modem, and what had been the main eero was now just another access point, connected only to the now-unretired router."></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">My first attempt at putting the eeros in bridge mode and un-retiring my old router.</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Suffice to say, this didn’t work. I mean, it <em>kind of</em> worked: the Raspberry Pi cluster was getting the right traffic forwarded to it. But seemingly random devices on the network would, suddenly and for no reason I could discern, disconnect and refuse to reconnect unless the <em>entire network</em> was rebooted.</p>
<p>Not exactly a tenable situation. So I reverted to the previous configuration where the eeros were in charge while I tried to figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>Fast forward about 8 months. I finally, <em>finally</em> found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eero/comments/nxlspa/psa_bridge_mode_is_not_what_you_think_it_is/">this post on Reddit</a> (because why would eero have it in their technical support documents?) from a couple years ago, with this critical element:</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2023-01-23-mastodon-home-network-topology/eero_bridge_network.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Screenshot of one post from the previous Reddit link, summarizing the precise network topology and positioning of the main eero in the sequence that eero expects in order to function correctly in bridge mode."></p>
<p>Apparently, even in bridge mode, there has to be at least one eero that can “see” the entirety of your home network (i.e., all incoming traffic should pass through it).</p>
<p>This… made absolutely no sense to me, as it directly contravened my understanding of “bridge mode”. But I went with it, and retooled my network to follow this new bit of information.</p>
<p>Here was my next attempt. Like my previous attempt, the router is connected directly to the ISP model. However, <em>unlike</em> my previous attempt, what was the “main” eero in the original configuration–while still connected to the router–now sits between the router and <em>the entire rest of the home network</em>, rather than just the router and… whatever devices deign to connect wirelessly to it.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2023-01-23-mastodon-home-network-topology/newest_topology.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="My final attempt at a home network setup that re-integrated my old router which could perform IP-based port forwarding. This took into account that at least one eero still needed to be able to see all the incoming traffic, so I made sure there was one situated in between the now-unretired router and the rest of the home network. This seemed to resolve the issues and has been my stable configuration for several months now."></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">My final attempt at a network reconfiguration, this time putting one eero ahead of the rest of the home network.</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This configuration, while still strange to me, officially works–or at least, it’s worked for the past few months with no issues.</p>
</section>
<section id="load-balancers-green" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="load-balancers-green">Load balancers: green</h3>
<p>With the issue of the k3s Raspberry Pi cluster being able to receive incoming traffic from the wider internet effectively resolved, I could now undertake the process of installing a Mastodon instance on the cluster with gusto.</p>
<p>In the next post, we’ll look at the <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/chart">Mastodon Helm chart</a> in all its glory. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>As I mentioned in my previous post, I spent the last month of last year spinning up my own Mastodon instance (<a href="https://quinnwitz.house/">which you can check out</a>!) I’ve had a Raspberry Pi cluster of 5x Pi 4B modules sitting around for the better part of the last two years<sup>1</sup>. I’ve occasionally toyed with installing <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a> and experimenting with various bits and pieces of kubernetes, but never actually deployed something I found useful.</p>

</div>
<p>Don’t get me wrong–I do want to go over how I installed and configured k3s on my Raspberry Pi cluster. It’s remarkable how quickly this area of things moves, and the guides I was working off for this were all 2-3 years old, and <em>remarkably</em> outdated. So a more recent tutorial on that basic component would definitely have its niche, I think.</p>
<p>But first, I want to kick off a series of posts detailing how I got a Mastodon instance running! It took a surprising amount of wrangling, so I wanted to share my experience before I forget the tiny details.</p>
<p>Why would you be interested in this series? Aside from the usual rough-and-tumble of installing anything on kubernetes via <a href="https://helm.sh/">helm</a>, the two parts that took the greatest amount of time and effort were 1) getting the Mastodon <em>dependencies</em> to work, and 2) wrestling <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> into submission. That first point is interesting because while Mastodon itself works just fine on ARM, the default images included in the Mastodon helm chart for the dependencies do <em>NOT</em>, and so it won’t work out-of-the-box on a Raspberry Pi cluster. And the second point was just plain rage-inducing, and I’d love for folks to not have to experience that.</p>
<p>I’ll fill in the links as I write the posts, so that you can bookmark this page if you’d like, though I’ll make sure to include the links on the other posts as well as I write them. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to drop any pointers / corrections / questions!</p>

<p>There’s going to be <em>language</em> in this post. Consider skipping if you prefer your blog posts merely warmed and with cream; this one is straight out of the pourover.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>2022 was a fucking shitshow.</p>
<p>Forget the transition out of academia that fell flat on its fucking face in the final mile<sup>1</sup>. Forget the actual running that went from runway to runway, gunning the engine and building some speed on occasion but without ever quite taking off. Forget 2022’s parting shot of giving our entirely family COVID within days of the year’s end (save our daughter, miraculously and thankfully) when we’ve been so diligent for three fucking years. Forget that we’ve been pretty much the only ones still wearing masks on planes and at our daughter’s daycare, as if “I’ve decided to get on with my life” somehow makes the pandemic over simply by willing it; as if it’s impossible to “get on with life” while also taking basic fucking precautions that hurt no one and help everyone.</p>
<p>All of that was rage-inducing beyond words and each deserve their own posts to really break down. But the real story of my 2022 was of burnout that I foolishly thought I could outrun.</p>
<section id="burnout-dances-to-its-own-tune" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="burnout-dances-to-its-own-tune">Burnout dances to its own tune</h3>
<p>I’ve been burned out for quite awhile now; realistically, there are likely roots going all the way back to graduate school, but things really kicked into gear with the tenure-track position and the stress it brought.</p>
<p>The pandemic didn’t create anything new in this regard, but it did act as a force multiplier, frying what little bandwidth I had left and forcing me to confront just how toxic my working circumstances were.</p>
<p>This was all complicated by the birth of my daughter, happening at the same time as my promotion and tenure process, wrapped up in some of the most gratuitous displays of academia’s <em>utter disdain</em> both for growing families and, it turns out, straightforward public health guidelines around pandemic mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, when I landed a job at Quansight in mid-late 2021, I jumped at the possibility of an exit strategy. Admittedly, I jumped way, way too soon: I was worried of losing the opportunity if I waited (irony), I didn’t have anything approximating a concrete exit strategy from academia (haste), and I thought I could hold down two positions long enough to gracefully exit (fucking LOL).</p>
</section>
<section id="writing-on-the-wall" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="writing-on-the-wall">Writing on the wall</h3>
<p>Even when I formalized a sabbatical beginning August 2022–an entire <em>eight months</em> after I started working full-time at Quansight–I was so far beyond any kind of discernible burnout threshold that it’s a miracle I lasted another three months before leaving.</p>
<p>Through all of 2022, my burnout was so severe that entire consecutive weeks would go by where I napped <em>daily</em> just to make it through the day. I was besieged by migraine headaches at the base of my neck that radiated down my legs; they wouldn’t respond to ibuprofen, and made literally any activity impossible. By the fall, I was having these migraines 3-4 days a <em>week</em>. But the <em>coup de gr<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7Ba%7D">ce</em>, the real cherry on top of it all was how, on a given work week in 2022, my upper bound for productivity was probably about 25% efficiency.</p>
<p>Yes, I typed that correctly: on a given 40-hour work week, I at my peak could probably crank out about 10 hours of real, actual work. Most of the time, I was operating at some sigma less than that. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBfTrjPSShs">I’ll take my promotion now</a>.</p>
<p>The weirdest thing about this level of burnout probably answers the obvious burning question following that previous revelation: I had no idea this was all related, or that there was even really a problem. The headaches were annoying, the naps made things bearable (in a sense), and surely I was just still getting the hang of things and I’d soon start churning out productive weeks? After all, I just had to hold out until I could sever all ties to academia in… 6-8 more months.</p>
<p>About that.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p>To address the (one of many, I suspect) elephant in the room: wasn’t I on sabbatical from my academic role? Yes, dear reader, I was. And it was still requiring at least a handful of hours from me, on a good week. Some sabbatical.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, October. Our entire family got RSV in the second half of October. Didn’t I mention that earlier? No? Yeah, that was an entire week where all three of us were sick (so no daycare for kiddo), followed by a second week where my daughter and I developed secondary bacterial infections! Great for the aforementioned productivity!</p>

<section id="no-options-given" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="no-options-given">No options given</h3>
<p>If there’s anything positive to be said about burnout, it’s this: eventually, it gives you no choice. You reach a point where it’s physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, ecumenically, and grammatically <em>impossible</em> to keep moving forward.</p>
<p>Without going into detail<sup>2</sup>, that point came just before Thanksgiving. I left Quansight. I took the entire month of December off. And hooooooly shit y’all, but that month was, honest-to-goodness, maybe the first time in over a year I not only stopped digging the burnout hole deeper, but <em>actually started filling it back in</em>. I can’t describe the feeling of my brain lighting up and making connections and actually <em>functioning</em>–I spun up our household Mastodon instance in that time<sup>3</sup>! I actually recovered a bit, holy <em>fuck</em>.</p>
<p>And only then did I slowly begin to realize how absolutely <em>fucked</em> I’d been the entire year up until that point. How the <em>fuck</em> did I expect to be able to continue down this road for another <em>six to eight MONTHS</em>?</p>
<p>It seems ridiculous–laughable, if it didn’t border so close to outright dangerous–but only in hindsight.</p>

<p>My 2022 was defined by my burnout… but also by my realization of its full extent. And, in doing so, by the start of me turning things around.</p>
<p>Beyond burnout, there were some other events and accomplishments in 2022 that were cause for celebration by themselves.</p>
<p>My wife quit the job that was stifling her and is now pursuing her dreams as a full-time fiction writer. This was one of the very first things I learned about her all those years ago when we met<sup>4</sup>, and the fact that she’s living it now–and all the challenges and anxieties and freedoms and blessings it comes with–makes me prouder than I’ve been of anyone in years.</p>
<p>Speaking of my wife and her writing, she finished a complete draft of the book she’s been working on for the past bit. I finished reading it a week or so ago, and I <em>fucking love it</em>. I may be a little biased, but I also read 30 books last year according to my StoryGraph<sup>5</sup>, so I have at least an inkling of what I’m talking about. She’s an amazing writer; you should buy it when it’s published!</p>
<p>My daughter is rapidly turning into the most fiery and powerful person I could have ever hoped she would be. It’s exhausting and enthralling and I’m so freaking happy to be her dad.</p>
<p>We did, in fact, solve some of the flooding problems around our house<sup>6</sup>. We had extensive work done on the back and front yards, and I can proudly say that our front yard is virtually problem-free and our backyard is… better. Obviously there’s more to be done, but in exchange for a lot of money there was a good amount of progress toward eliminating the literal rivers that swirl around our house during a downpour.</p>
<p>For all my breathless pearl-clutching around my running failures, 2022 was, by any reasonable measure, an improvement over 2021, and those improvements should be celebrated… even if they aren’t the <em>impossible gains</em> I wanted.</p>
<p>Strava has a fitness estimate tracker; it’s obscenely biased in ways I can’t begin to wrap my head around, but it seems like a moderate-to-low variance estimator, so it provides a decent relative intuition on fitness over time. And I have to say: given my 2022, it’s halfway ok.</p>

<p>Speaking of running, my total mileage improved year-over-year. I also ran my first half marathon since before COVID<sup>7</sup>. It was the slowest half I’ve ever run (by a lot), but I finished. I also ran a handful of other races last year, which helped remind me that racing is a lot of fun–which helped remind me that <em>running is a lot of fun</em>.</p>

<p>I spun up an entire Mastodon instance, <a href="https://quinnwitz.house/">Casa Quinnwitz</a>, on my homelab Raspberry Pi cluster (shout-out to the Mastodon dev team, which is full of super kind and patient folks). It’s pretty much my new socialz home, since Twitter has been rendered all-but-unusable with Tweetbot and all the other third-party clients going belly-up. I kind of love the vibe there; feels very longer-form-proto-Twitter with a pre-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September">Eternal September</a> thing going.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>
<p>I’m back in the academy this semester, teaching my <a href="https://dsp-uga.github.io/sp23">data science practicum</a> course while guiding a half dozen of my remaining students to graduation in May. I have a weekly structure in place that balances my obligations to the academy with my needs for continuing rest, exercise, and <em>my own fun shit</em>. I’m still feeling the after-effects of COVID but am hoping that will taper off as I get back into running again, training for a half marathon in April and multiple shorter races before then. I have a concrete exit strategy from academy, and a timeline of events and milestones to accompany it.</p>
<p>Crucially, I’ve also adopted a new strategy for handling work-related items coming my way: <strong><em>NO</em></strong>.</p>
<p>No, I’m not taking new students.</p>
<p>No, I can’t review for your conference/study section/journal.</p>
<p>No, I’m not open to new research collaborations.</p>
<p>No, I can’t sit on your [insert topic here] panel<sup>9</sup>.</p>
<p>No, I’m not going to be on that committee.</p>
<p>No no no no no. No.</p>
<p>It’s a really hard fucking thing for a lifetime people-pleaser to set up boundaries, but for me in this moment, it’s both a matter of mere survival as well as a pathway to doing what I <em>really</em> love.</p>
<p>Here’s to a 2023 of healing. Much love to all of you 🥂</p>

<p>Why hello there. You may have noticed that things look a little bit different around here.</p>
<p>I’m in the process of migrating my blog <em>off</em> <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> and <em>on</em> to <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>.</p>
<p>Why, you ask? Honestly, I got tired of having to fix a broken plugin or failed <code>git push</code> <em>every. single. time.</em> that I finished writing out a blog post. It gave an already-infrequent task an even higher activation threshold, and during a stretch where spare bandwidth was an incredible luxury.</p>
<p>In short: I’d really like to blog more often, and from what I’ve seen, Quarto will help me do just that. It definitely requires some extra bandwidth to get things migrated over, but fortunately: I have some of that at the moment :)</p>
<p>Stay tuned! In the meantime, please enjoy the above recent photo of Clover helping us put up our tree.</p>

  <title>Summer of Data Science 2017</title>
  <dc:creator>Shannon Quinn</dc:creator>
  <link>https://magsol.github.io/posts/2017-05-31-summer-of-data-science/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2017-05-31-summer-of-data-science/carpelibrum.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>A few days ago, while I was still in Portland, OR enjoying the last few days of <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2017/">PyCon 2017</a>, Renee (<a href="https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci"><span class="citation" data-cites="BecomingDataSci">@BecomingDataSci</span></a>) mentioned on Twitter that she might bring back the “Summer of Data Science” she kicked off last year.</p>
<p>In short: use the summer as an opportunity to learn and/or accomplish something data science-related in a goal-oriented, data-driven way.</p>
<p>As a tenure-track professor still yet to endure the 3rd-year review, pretty much everything data science related revolves around furthering my eventual tenure dossier. But the summers are still considerably more flexible for me to accomplish some of these goals than the fall or spring (I love teaching, but it’s all-consuming). I also have more than just myself–networks of collaborators and research assistants who can help me with these goals.</p>
<p>So without further adieu, I’d like to put forth my own Summer of Data Science, 2017 Edition:</p>
<section id="teaching-1360e-improvements-and-43606360-preparation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="teaching-1360e-improvements-and-43606360-preparation">Teaching: 1360E improvements and 4360/6360 preparation</h3>
<p>I’m teaching an online course this summer, starting June 5 and continuing through the end of July: <a href="https://eds-uga.github.io/csci1360e-su17/">CSCI 1360E Foundations of Informatics and Analytics</a>.</p>
<p>Or, more colloquially, I just call it “introduction to data science.”</p>
<p>It’s one of the five courses I proposed in my first year (a story for another time, believe me…) and taught for the first time last summer, and in-person last fall. I’m teaching it again this summer and hoping to make some of the standard improvements, such as sprucing up slides and fixing autograder bugs from previous incarnations.</p>
<p>More pressing is CSCI 4360/6360 Data Science II, which has yet to have its own website. This course has <em>never</em> been taught, but is slated for Fall 2017.</p>
<p>Did I mention there are already over 40 students registered, undergraduate and graduate combined?</p>
<p>This is supposed to be the “corner cases” of data science: lesser-used and/or more powerful analysis methods that aren’t necessarily the first tools or techniques you reach for in a given situation. This will include, but certainly not be limited to, concepts like randomized algorithms, semi-supervised learning, and backpropagation; techniques like out-of-core processing, distributed computing, and functional programming; tools like <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>, <a href="http://numba.pydata.org/">numba</a>, and <a href="http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/">dask</a>.</p>
<p>Before you ask: No.&nbsp;I’m <em>not</em> covering Spark.</p>
<p>At any rate, the conceptual framework is in place, but practically none of the architectural logistics have been established. So this will take up virtually all of my time for the remainder of the summer, once the following item is completed…</p>
</section>
<section id="research-nsf-career-proposal" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="research-nsf-career-proposal">Research: NSF CAREER proposal</h3>
<p>The advantage of this goal is it has a hard end date: <strong>July 19</strong>.</p>
<p>The disadvantage is that the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2017/nsf17537/nsf17537.htm">NSF CAREER</a> is the pinnacle of NSF early-career investigator awards. Its importance cannot be overstated; its <em>je ne sais quoi</em> is on display in the faces of new investigators when you mention it around them.</p>
<p>I’ve connected with my university’s grant proposal officers, and am participating in a peer review process that involves two rounds of review: first with fellow CAREER submitees (as in, we exchange each other’s current drafts!), and second with the university grant officers.</p>
<p>An investigator can only make three submission attempts for the CAREER. The CAREER is only open for submissions once per year. If chosen, the investigator must still be un-tenured at time of award. These conditions place brutal limits on how long you can wait to start making submissions, and I already skipped submitting my first two years. Still, I have no illusions about the uphill battle I have, so my goal this first time around is simply to <strong>acquire feedback</strong>: from my peers, from my grants officers, and from the NSF reviewers.</p>
</section>
<section id="personal-courseras-optimization-course" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="personal-courseras-optimization-course">Personal: Coursera’s optimization course</h3>
<p>I signed up to take Coursera’s <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization/home/welcome">Discrete Optimization course</a> out of the University of Melbourne, taught by none other than <a href="https://pascalvanhentenryck.engin.umich.edu/">Professor Pascal Van Hentenryck</a> at Michigan and <a href="http://www.coffr.in/">Dr.&nbsp;Carleton Coffrin</a>, currently at Los Alamos.</p>
<p>Optimization is pretty much the backbone of modern machine learning, and yet I have almost no formal training in it–beyond incidentally covering it in various machine learning and statistics courses as part of some broader topic in which it’s used. Oddly, the most rigorous instruction I received as a graduate student in optimization was a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/cellandsystemsmodeling/">Cell &amp; Systems Modeling course</a> where we used various optimization techniques to find parameter values for population models.</p>
<p>Especially in conjunction with what I hope to teach in CSCI 4360 in the fall, this would be invaluable both professionally as well as personally.</p>

  <title>So, you want to conduct research with me?</title>
  <dc:creator>Shannon Quinn</dc:creator>
  <link>https://magsol.github.io/posts/2017-03-16-so-you-want-to-conduct-research-with-me/index.html</link>

<p><em>Deviation #1</em>: This is wholly separate from the <a href="http://shouldigetaphd.com/">“should I get a Ph.D.”</a> question. For that I would recommend one of numerous guides that ask all the right questions.</p>
<p><em>Deviation #2</em>: This is also wholly separate from how to <em>succeed</em> in a Ph.D.&nbsp;program, though there is some overlap. In general, there are some key items to consider and habits to build as you work your way through a Ph.D., and for those questions I highly recommend <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/">Andrej Karpathy’s excellent survival guide to a Ph.D.</a>, some of which may be mirrored here.</p>
<p>No, the specific question I’m addressing here is <strong>how to succeed in graduate research as one of my students.</strong> In order of somewhat-importance:</p>
<section id="familiarize-yourself-with-my-research-interests." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="familiarize-yourself-with-my-research-interests.">1: Familiarize yourself with my research interests.</h3>
<p>This may seem like a no-brainer, but you’d be surprised how many emails I get from individuals expressing profound interest in working with me, only to see they have <strong>i)</strong> no experience whatsoever in any of my interests (which isn’t necessarily a deal-breaker!), and <strong>ii)</strong> don’t appear to know what I work on (which <em>is</em> a deal-breaker). If you work with me, you’re going to do something at the intersection of bioimaging + distributed computing + biosurveillance; something that involves computer vision and machine learning in a public health setting.</p>
<p>Check out my <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4EjRiycAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a> record, my group’s <a href="https://github.com/quinngroup">GitHub repositories</a>, and my <a href="https://quinngroup.github.io/">lab website</a> to get at least a basic idea of the sort of work I do, and to jog your thinking along the lines of what you might be able to contribute.</p>
</section>
<section id="take-into-consideration-the-following-expectations." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="take-into-consideration-the-following-expectations.">2: Take into consideration the following expectations.</h3>
<p>Work hard, play hard, and be able to talk about both:</p>
<ul>
<li>I expect my students to develop into excellent scientific communicators. In practice, this means I want you to be able to talk about your work to experts in the same field, experts in different fields, and even non-scientists. I want you to get comfortable giving talks and writing papers. If English isn’t your first language, that’s ok! Just be aware this expectation may take more time than you think.</li>
<li>I expect my students to participate in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">Open Science</a>. In practice, this means I want you to publish all the code you write in <a href="https://github.com/quinngroup">public repositories</a>, mirror all your papers on <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>, participate in and contribute to open source projects, and maybe even contribute to a blog. Research is only interesting when you can pick through the code, explore the data, and regenerate the results. Know or learn how to use <a href="http://jupyter.org/">scientific notebooks</a>, <a href="https://git-scm.com/">version control</a>, wikis, and even <a href="https://www.docker.com/">containers</a>!</li>
<li>I expect my students to demonstrate a <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/792823320441786368">promising slope of accomplishment</a>. Put simply, <a href="https://josh.works/blog/2015/6/25/a-little-bit-of-slope-makes-up-for-a-lot-of-y-intercept">I recruit for potential (slope), not experience (y-intercept)</a>. You don’t have to know everything about machine learning, statistics, and linear algebra, <em>and</em> be an expert programming in Python just to be able to work with me. However, I do expect that you will be able to pick up these skills very quickly.</li>
<li>I expect my students to take ownership of their projects, pushing the envelope of what is known and beyond what even I would suggest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking of which…</p>
</section>
<section id="prepare-yourself-to-be-a-self-sufficient-researcher." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prepare-yourself-to-be-a-self-sufficient-researcher.">3: Prepare yourself to be a self-sufficient researcher.</h3>
<p>This <strong>does NOT mean</strong> I expect you to do everything! The whole point of being a student is that you have a mentor, a supervisor who is (in theory) more experienced than you, from whom you can learn. It is indeed my job to guide you and teach you what I know, and I will most certainly do that.</p>
<p>This <strong>DOES mean</strong> that, by the end of your time here, I want you to be the expert on your project! You should take the project and run with it, rather than wait for me to tell you what to do next. Build your intuition about the problem through “moving fast and breaking things,” to use the tech startup parlance. Ask forgiveness rather than permission. Insert witticism here that basically says KEEP TRYING THINGS.</p>
<p>Even as you start your project, you may come across roadblocks that I don’t have an answer for. That’s how research works: we’re pushing the limits of our collective knowledge! I may have some intuition from previous problems, and I’ll certainly share that, but asking me “What do I do next?” is going to frustrate both of us very, very quickly.</p>
<p>Here’s another example: <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2017/03/16/evo-ds-class/">the levels of data science classes</a>. You don’t have to be anywhere above Level 2 when you arrive (maybe you’re still working your way through Level 1!), but I expect you to work <strong>through Level 7 by the time you leave.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="if-youve-made-it-this-far-and-are-still-interested" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="if-youve-made-it-this-far-and-are-still-interested">If you’ve made it this far, and are still interested…</h3>
<p>…then I encourage you to reach out to me and express your interest! I have just a few final pieces of advice:</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidBindel/status/1054859324143616000">read this brief Twitter thread</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mickeykats/status/1074874785795112960">this brief Twitter thread as well</a>.</p>
<p>Next, <strong>do NOT</strong> send me</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a form email with a 10-page summary of your accomplishments (as I said, I don’t hire for y-intercept, I hire for slope)</li>
<li>an email with misspellings or grammatical errors (recall that I emphasize good scientific communication skills)</li>
<li>a message that starts with “Dear Ms Quinn” (first, I’m a doctor; second, I’m a guy)</li>
</ol>
<p>I won’t respond.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://magsol.github.io/pages/contact.html">write an email</a> that’s 3-5 sentences at most, <strong>with a specific mention of the work you find interesting and want to pursue further</strong>. For extra credit, mention some kind of improvement or extension to the work that you came up with on your own. This tells me a lot of things all at once, most important of which is that you’re serious about wanting to work with me.</p>
<p>Because if you can handle graduate school…</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2017-03-16-so-you-want-to-conduct-research-with-me/grad-school.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>…I really do believe you can handle anything.</p>

  <title>Game-ify Your Raspberry Pi</title>
  <dc:creator>Shannon Quinn</dc:creator>
  <link>https://magsol.github.io/posts/2017-01-06-gameify-your-raspberry-pi/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2017-01-06-gameify-your-raspberry-pi/raspberrypi3.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>My project over the 2016 holiday season was to take the Raspberry Pi 3 I’ve had sitting around the house idling for the previous nine months and turn it into a <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/">RetroPie-ified gaming emulator</a>.</p>
<p>RetroPie is a phenomenal bit of software that combines the work of several projects into a single package that was primarily designed to be deployed on Raspberry Pis, but which can also be set up on a regular ol’ PC. If you’re using a Raspberry Pi, it’s built on top of the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">Raspbian OS</a>, so all the commands familiar to you will still be available.</p>
<p>I have to say up front: the folks with RetroPie have done an <em>amazing</em> job. The documentation was excellent, and while I’ll walk through the installation and configuration here, with only one notable exception everything went exactly as prescribed.</p>
<section id="retropie" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="retropie">RetroPie</h3>
<p>Assuming you have all the <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/documentation/building-your-own-retropie-machine/">needed hardware</a>, installing the RetroPie OS on your Pi is <a href="https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki/First-Installation">pretty straightforward</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use some sort of imaging software to write the RetroPie image to an SD card (I used <a href="http://www.tweaking4all.com/hardware/raspberry-pi/macosx-apple-pi-baker/">ApplePi Baker</a> without any problems, but you could also just use the <code>dd</code> command in the Terminal, which directly moves bytes from one place to another).</li>
<li>Insert the SD card into your Pi.</li>
<li>Boot! I had a few false-starts that were the result of the SD card not being fully inserted, so nothing came up.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all goes well, you should see the wonderful Raspbian logo.</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2017-01-06-gameify-your-raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-logo.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</section>
<section id="configuring-retropie" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="configuring-retropie">Configuring RetroPie</h3>
<p>The first thing you’ll need to do when RetroPie boots is to configure whatever controller you’re going to use. I went out and purchased some standard-issue <a href="http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/f310-gamepad">Logitech USB gamepads</a> and they seem to be functioning very well. You can also use your keyboard if you want for this, but it pretty much has to be something that can be connected via USB directly to the Pi.</p>
<p>A few pointers in this step:</p>
<ul>
<li>To skip a particular button configuration, just <strong>press and hold any button for a second</strong>.</li>
<li>If you make a mistake in configuring a button, you have to get all the way to the bottom before you can scroll back up and fix it.</li>
<li>It took me 5-6 tries to get this completely right. Just go back and do it again if you mess something up.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="emulationstation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="emulationstation">EmulationStation</h3>
<p>Once you successfully configure a gamepad, you’ll be taken to the main landing page: EmulationStation.</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2017-01-06-gameify-your-raspberry-pi/emulationstation.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><em>Where are teh gamez0rz?!1</em>, you might be saying. Well, since ROMs are a legal gray area, you’re kinda on your own there. BUT! We have something else we need to do first anyway: set up a network configuration.</p>
</section>
<section id="network-configuration" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="network-configuration">Network Configuration</h3>
<p>If you have a Raspberry Pi 2 or earlier, your network choices are limited to an ethernet connection. With the advent of Raspberry Pi 3s, suddenly wifi is an option! Turns out, I have a 3, and it is this wifi that caused me a couple hours’ grief until I figured out what was going on.</p>
<p>Go to the wifi configuration in EmulationStation. You’ll be taken to a network selection screen–protip, the Pi 3 <strong>cannot</strong> connect to 5GHz networks–where you can select your wifi network.</p>
<p>You’ll then need to type in the wifi password. Provided you get it right, that should be it! You’re all set to go!</p>
<p>If you find yourself entering your password again…and again…and again…and again…and can’t figure out why it’s failing, read on.</p>
</section>
<section id="keyboard-layout" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="keyboard-layout">Keyboard Layout</h3>
<p>For whatever reason, my keyboard was misconfigured–the layout was set to English (U.K.), resulting in some special characters being remapped. However, since the Raspbian password interface echoes stars <code>*</code> back, I had no idea I was typing a completely wrong password until I fired up a command prompt.</p>
<p>Luckily, once you diagnose this issue, it’s fairly easy to fix. Raspbian has a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=80127">utility built-in for changing your keyboard layout</a>. You just have to navigate in EmulationStation to the option that gives you a command prompt.</p>
<p>In my case, once I had a working network connection, I just used SSH to perform any other operations on the Pi (e.g.&nbsp;uploading new games). The default username/password for RetroPie is <code>pi/raspberry</code>, which I suggest you change either from the EmulationStation main menu, or after your first SSH login.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="moonlight-on-raspberry-pi">Moonlight on Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p>You should have a working RetroPie at this point, so that’s cool!</p>
<p>However, as awesome as the Pis are, they’re not exactly brimming with horsepower. As such, if you try running N64 or PS2 emulators, you may find as I did that anything requiring 3D shaders gets <em>very</em> jittery, to the point of unplayable. RetroPie has <a href="https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki">detailed configuration options for every emulator</a> to help you get the absolute most out of your Pi, but there are some things a tiny CPU with an embedded stock GPU just can’t do, and one of those is render 3D shaders the way they were meant to be.</p>
<p>So what? Give up? <em>Nay!</em></p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2017-01-06-gameify-your-raspberry-pi/moonlight.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/irtimmer/moonlight-embedded/wiki">Moonlight Embedded</a> is the open source version of NVIDIA’s GameStream as used by the NVIDIA Shield. Basically, it’s a way of streaming the output of an NVIDIA GPU to another input, like a TV.</p>
<p>In this case, we’re basically turning our Pi into a glorified Chromecast–it’ll take the output from a dedicated GPU and stream it directly to the TV it’s connected to. Yes, this means you’re not actually playing games <em>on</em> the Raspberry Pi–you’re playing them on whatever computer has the GPU in it (oh and it has to be an NVIDIA GPU, GTX 650 or higher)–but all Moonlight requires is Raspbian, which is what RetroPie is built on!</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://blog.jhot.me/guide-install-moonlight-on-raspbian-retropie-9d1318b8ddf8#.etf7g4bo6">this installation guide</a> perfect (make sure you download the latest versions of everything!), with the lone exception that, just before downloading and installing Moonlight itself, I also needed to install one more library:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1">    <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">sudo</span> apt-get install libenet-dev</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Include that with the other libraries installed just before Moonlight, and everything else should just work. The rest of the instructions take you through configuring the gamepads so they correctly send their input back to the GPU (so, y’know, you don’t have to sit at your computer while staring at your TV).</p>

<section id="happy-fun-times" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="happy-fun-times">Happy Fun Times!</h3>
<p>Yes, lots of happy fun times. But also <a href="http://docs.happyfuntimes.net/docs/introduction.html">HappyFunTimes</a>!</p>
<p>If you’re really into the party games, installing this gaming server may be the best thing ever. It’s a brilliant setup: gamepads are HTML5 canvases that run on smartphones, essentially mimicking controllers so everyone with a smartphone can play. The games range from stupidly simple to shockingly sophisticated. I may post configuration for that later, but I figure: if you’re building the Ultimate Gaming Pi, why not include that, too?</p>
<p>And with that, I give you the results at our house:</p>

  <title>Open Science in Big Data (OSBD) Workshop</title>
  <dc:creator>Shannon Quinn</dc:creator>
  <link>https://magsol.github.io/posts/2016-09-26-osbd2016-workshop/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2016-09-26-osbd2016-workshop/washingtondc.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Back in May of this year, some of the other computer science professors and I put together a proposal for a workshop. The workshop would be in conjunction with the December 2016 <a href="http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2016/">IEEE BigData Conference</a>, and would focus specifically on the intersection of big data and open science.</p>
<p>In June, we got the good news: it was accepted!</p>
<section id="what-is-open-science" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-open-science"><em>What is “Open Science”?</em></h3>
<p>I’ve been interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">open science</a> since I started graduate school. I’d been using Apache projects since college, learning how to set up and configure my own LAMP stack (yes, I’ll admit I dabbled in PHP for a few years, but I’m clean now!), but had never really contributed to an open source project until the 2010 Google Summer of Code. During that time, I worked on adding spectral clustering the <a href="http://mahout.apache.org">Apache Mahout</a> library.</p>
<p>While open source is great and wonderful, this is just one component of Open Science. It’s another reason I’m incredibly excited about the “container revolution”: Docker and its ilk. This concept makes entire pipelines perfectly reproducible, to the point where it’s now possible for entire scientific projects to be replicated with a single command: from running the analysis, to building the figures, to assembling the final PDF file (which, by the way, can be uploaded to <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv</a> for everyone to read!)</p>
<p>These other aspects–open sourcing data, reproducibility scripts, and entire pipelines–are veritable educational and research gold mines, but are arguably much more difficult than simply dumping some code on GitHub. <strong>These difficulties are only exacerbated in the realm of “big data”.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="what-are-the-goals-of-the-workshop" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-the-goals-of-the-workshop"><em>What are the goals of the workshop?</em></h3>
<p>The goals of the workshop are threefold.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>: we aim to <em>identify some of the biggest challenges</em> in democratizing big data analytics. Open Science is a critical component of both educational pedagogy and scientific research. With the increasing relevance of big data analytics, making these tools and resources available to the next generation of scientists and big data practitioners is crucial. Unfortunately, this is also extremely challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>: we aim to bring together big data practitioners from multiple backgrounds to <em>discuss and establish the current state of affairs</em> with respect to reproducibility in big data analytics and machine learning. Priorities change and constraints differ between researchers and developers in academia versus industry versus government; nonetheless, open science and big data are important to practitioners in each of these areas.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>: we aim to <em>examine and propose possible routes forward</em> to advance the continued integration of open science in big data analytics, putting tools, techniques, data, and documentation in the hands of researchers, students, and other big data practitioners. We will identify emerging trends in terms of open science best practices, and how these can be incorporated into current big data endeavors.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-kinds-of-proceedings-is-the-workshop-accepting" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-kinds-of-proceedings-is-the-workshop-accepting"><em>What kinds of proceedings is the workshop accepting?</em></h3>
<p>We hope to have two tracks: a full research paper session, and a student (short) paper session.</p>
<p>Papers submitted to the OSBD workshop should, at the very minimum, have a significant Open Science component. This can take several forms, including but not limited to any combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uses free and open source packages</li>
<li>Openly available online, e.g.&nbsp;GitHub</li>
<li>Scripts are available to reproduce figures</li>
<li>Data are openly available e.g.&nbsp;dat, datahub.io</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are welcoming of original research into big data analytics, so long as there is an open science component.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the spirit of Open Science and reproducibility, we strongly encourage our presenters to incorporate live code demos, data walkthroughs, or some other hands-on activity into their talks.</p>
</section>
<section id="when-is-the-submission-deadline" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="when-is-the-submission-deadline"><em>When is the submission deadline?</em></h3>
<p>The deadline for workshop paper submissions is <strong>Sunday, October 25, 2016</strong>. This provides a 2-week buffer zone between the notification deadline of the main IEEE BigData conference, in case you want to repackage your conference submission for the workshop.</p>
</section>
<section id="where-can-one-find-more-information-about-osbd" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-can-one-find-more-information-about-osbd"><em>Where can one find more information about OSBD?</em></h3>
<p>We have a website: <strong><a href="https://osbd.github.io/" target="_blank">https://osbd.github.io/</a></strong></p>
<p>The website contains information about the topics around the workshop, the invited speakers who will be attending (keynote and panelists), the important dates around the workshop, and the instructions for formatting and submitting your paper to the workshop.</p>
<p>We are very excited about this workshop, and encourage you to submit! We look forward to seeing you in December!</p>

  <title>A twitterbot for posting weekly running stats</title>
  <dc:creator>Shannon Quinn</dc:creator>
  <link>https://magsol.github.io/posts/2016-05-16-autopost-running-twitter-summary-strava/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2016-05-16-autopost-running-twitter-summary-strava/stravatwitter.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We runners (we’re a crazy bunch), for the most part, like our stats. How many miles do you log each week? Each month? How are your average race paces trending? Are your long runs both feeling good and getting faster?</p>
<p>Yes, we’re a little obsessed with our numbers.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise, then, that web services have popped up to help us aggregate some of these numbers. One of the most obvious is <a href="https://connect.garmin.com/">Garmin Connect</a>, home for pretty much anyone who uses the Garmin GPS watches.</p>
<p>Another that I’ve used before is <a href="http://www.dailymile.com/">Daily Mile</a>. However in recent months I’ve become frustrated enough with the site to leave entirely. By all accounts, no part of the site has been updated in <em>years</em>, and <a href="https://wherearethepancakes.wordpress.com/2013/05/20/my-ideal-running-statistics-site/">other alternatives</a> are simply much more pleasant to use.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was one crucial feature of Daily Mile I really liked: connecting it to your Twitter account to post weekly summaries of your recorded workouts. I liked it so much, in fact, I created a small web service to do the same thing, <a href="https://wherearethepancakes.wordpress.com/2014/06/11/open-beta-for-twathletic/">but for monthly summaries</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2016-05-16-autopost-running-twitter-summary-strava/https:/wherearethepancakes.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/example.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Obviously that service no longer exists, but ever since I’ve been wanting to get something similar up and running again. Especially now that I don’t even have weekly summaries anymore–just couldn’t stomach Daily Mile any longer–I wanted to take the opportunity (and the shiny new blog) to go through a step-by-step procedure of creating your own Twitter / Strava app for posting weekly summaries on Twitter of your running mileage!</p>
<section id="preliminaries" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preliminaries"><strong>Preliminaries</strong></h3>
<p>A few things you’ll need before we get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python 3.5</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tweepy.org/">tweepy</a> (for interfacing with Twitter)</li>
<li><a href="http://pythonhosted.org/stravalib/">stravalib</a> (for interfacing with Strava)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/magsol/pybot">pybot</a> (shameless plug, but it will help)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Twitter and Strava use OAuth as their method of app authentication. These libraries just make it easier to interact with the services; they abstract a lot of the details of authentication and communication.</p>
<p>But in case you’re interested: <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation">Twitter’s docs</a> and <a href="http://strava.github.io/api/">Strava’s docs</a>.</p>
<section id="step-1-create-a-strava-app" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1-create-a-strava-app"><strong>Step 1: Create a Strava app</strong></h4>
<p>Go to your <a href="https://www.strava.com/settings/api">user settings</a> and create an app that can interface with your account. Important pieces of information you’ll need later: <strong>Client ID</strong>, <strong>Client Secret</strong>, and <strong>Your access token</strong>.</p>
<p>We can test if it works. Fire up an IPython terminal, get your <code>access_token</code>, and run the following code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1">    <span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">from</span> stravalib <span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">import</span> Client</span>
<span id="cb1-2">    client <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> Client(access_token <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> access_token)</span>
<span id="cb1-3">    client.get_athlete()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You should see something along the lines of:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1">    Out[]: <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">&lt;</span>Athlete <span class="bu" style="color: null;">id</span><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">1234567</span> firstname<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">b'Firstname'</span> lastname<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">b'Lastname'</span><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
</section>
<section id="step-2-retrieve-last-weeks-data" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-2-retrieve-last-weeks-data"><strong>Step 2: Retrieve last week’s data</strong></h4>
<p>The whole point is to get weekly mileage reports. Thankfully, the <code>get_activities</code> method in stravalib has an <code>after</code> optional parameter we can use to precisely tune what time interval we want.</p>
<p>First, though, we need to create a timestamp that represents the 1-week time frame. If we assume this will only be executed on the day we want the summary–say, every Monday–then we need to tally up all the runs from the day before all the way back to the previous Monday, inclusive.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1">    <span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">import</span> datetime</span>
<span id="cb3-2">    current <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> datetime.datetime.now()</span>
<span id="cb3-3">    last_week <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> current <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">+</span> datetime.timedelta(weeks <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">-</span><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">1</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-4">    after <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> datetime.datetime(last_week.year, last_week.month, last_week.day)</span>
<span id="cb3-5">    activities <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> client.get_activities(after <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> after)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Assuming we run this chunk of code on a Monday, it should give us every Strava activity from the previous Monday up to the present.</p>
<p>However, we’re not done yet. This includes everything–not just our runs, but any other activities that we recorded; yoga, weights, elliptical, and so on. We need to filter these out. We also need to filter out the edge case of any activities that have been recorded <em>today</em>, since we don’t want to include these in a report of <em>last</em> week’s activities!</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb4-1">    l <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> [activity.<span class="bu" style="color: null;">id</span> <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">for</span> activity <span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">in</span> activities <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">if</span> activity.<span class="bu" style="color: null;">type</span> <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">==</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">'Run'</span> \</span>
<span id="cb4-2">        <span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">and</span> a.start_date_local.day <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">!=</span> current.day]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Ok, let’s pause and discuss what’s happening here.</p>
<p>First, the most obvious: we’re looping through the <code>activities</code> generator we obtained in the last line of the previous step. Second, the <code>if</code> statement at the end filters out any activities that aren’t a run. Finally, the <code>activity.id</code> part out front says, we’re building a list of the unique IDs that identify each activity. The last part is our timeframe edge case: if we recorded an activity today, even a running activity, don’t include it.</p>
<p>Why are we only holding onto the IDs? It has to do with detail. Strava maintains a hierarchy of details available to users that vary with authentication, connection, etc. Simply put, when we request a list of activities, <a href="http://strava.github.io/api/v3/activities/#get-activities">the default detail level is 2, which is “summary” level</a>. However, some of the metrics we need–calories in particular!–require level 3, or “detailed”. To get this level of detail, we need to query for individual activities…one at a time.</p>
<p>Hence, a list of activity IDs! Now we can loop through the IDs, requesting details on each run and tabulating up the mileage and calories.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb5-1">    <span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">from</span> stravalib <span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">import</span> unithelper</span>
<span id="cb5-2"></span>
<span id="cb5-3">    mileage <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="fl" style="color: #AD0000;">0.0</span>, calories <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="fl" style="color: #AD0000;">0.0</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4">    <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">for</span> activity_id <span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">in</span> l:</span>
<span id="cb5-5">        activity <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> client.get_activity(activity_id)</span>
<span id="cb5-6"></span>
<span id="cb5-7">        <span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;"># This is annoying; all the default distances are in meters! Luckily,</span></span>
<span id="cb5-8">        <span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;"># stravalib comes with a nice unit helper utility to do the conversion.</span></span>
<span id="cb5-9">        distance <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> unithelper.miles(activity.distance)</span>
<span id="cb5-10">        mileage <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">+=</span> <span class="bu" style="color: null;">round</span>(distance.num, <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">2</span>)  <span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;"># Rounds to 2 sig figs.</span></span>
<span id="cb5-11">        calories <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">+=</span> activity.calories</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There you have it! In those two variables–<code>mileage</code> and <code>calories</code>–you have all the data you need to summarize your running workouts for the last week. Now we just need to post this information on Twitter!</p>
</section>
<section id="step-3-create-a-pybot" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-3-create-a-pybot"><strong>Step 3: Create a PyBot</strong></h4>
<p>Ok, time for a shameless plug: yes, I’m the <a href="https://github.com/magsol/pybot">pybot</a> author. It’s still highly experimental, and largely uncompleted, but for our purposes it will suffice nicely as a barebones framework to interact with Twitter.</p>
<p>Clone the repo and follow the setup script to create a Twitter app and connect it to your account.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1">    <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">git</span> clone https://github.com/magsol/pybot.git</span>
<span id="cb6-2">    <span class="bu" style="color: null;">cd</span> pybot</span>
<span id="cb6-3">    <span class="ex" style="color: null;">sbin/create_pybot.py</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>That will walk you through the instructions for creating an app, generating OAuth credentials, and stubbing out your first pybot. Feel free to give it whatever name you’d like; for the purposes of this tutorial, I’ll assume we’ve named it <code>artbot</code> (don’t ask). Congratulations! You’ve created a twitter bot!</p>
</section>
<section id="step-4-customize-the-bots-behavior" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-4-customize-the-bots-behavior"><strong>Step 4: Customize the bot’s behavior</strong></h4>
<p>Our bot is pretty simple: every Monday at some specified time, it will wake up, read all the prior week’s running activities, and post the summary before going back to sleep for another week.</p>
<p>It won’t be prompted by anything other than time. So the specific action override we’re looking for in PyBot parlance is <code>on_tweet</code>, and the interval we’ll use is <code>tweet_interval</code>. The latter is easy enough–a full week between tweets!</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb7-1">    <span class="va" style="color: #111111;">self</span>.config[<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">'tweet_interval'</span>] <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">60</span> <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">*</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">60</span> <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">*</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">24</span> <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">*</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">7</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Before we go any further: does anyone see anything wrong with the above code snippet?</p>
<p>I’ll give you a hint: imagine you started this bot on a Tuesday, instead of a Monday.</p>
<p>Yep, there it is. This interval we’ve defined is exactly 1 week, but it <em>doesn’t account for when we actually START the bot</em>. We need this to be a little more intelligent. If you want the posting to happen weekly every Monday, it shouldn’t matter when you actually start running the bot, right? It should be smart enough to figure out when it needs to post for the first time, <em>then</em> post weekly thereafter.</p>
<p>A neat component of PyBot is that, in addition to giving hard time frames, you can also specify functions to compute the interval on-the-fly, subject to some other constraints that are dynamic (like on what day of the week you happen to fire up the bot).</p>
<p>To make things easy on us, we’ll use the <code>datetime</code> convention in the Python documentation for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.weekday">identifying individual days of the week</a>. This tutorial assumes Mondays (which corresponds to <code>0</code>), but you can use whatever value you want.</p>
<p>We need to store this as a configuration parameter in the bot.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb8-1">    <span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;"># Put this somewhere in the bot_init() method</span></span>

<p>Now, we need a <em>function</em> to compute the interval between updates.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>That’s all there is to it! There are obviously a lot of technical hurdles I largely glossed over–creating the apps for both Strava and Twitter can be a little more involved than the average person would like, and Python versions (especially 2.x vs 3.x) can wreak havoc on your code. I tried to be as reproducible as I could, though until Jupyter notebooks decide to play nice with Pelican (or maybe the other way around?) these code embeddings will have to suffice. Sigh.</p>
<p>Please feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions! I’ve also posted the bot in the <code>examples</code> folder in the <a href="https://github.com/magsol/pybot">pybot GitHub repository</a> as <code>artbot.py</code>. Happy tweeting!</p>

  <title>Reviewing a reviewed grant’s reviews</title>
  <dc:creator>Shannon Quinn</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Rejection in any context sucks. As a new faculty trying to prove himself (to himself, but most importantly, to his tenure committee), I particularly hate rejections in the context of grant proposals and paper submissions. The “nice” thing about the latter rejection is that it’s marginally easier to resubmit a manuscript elsewhere; there are more journals and conferences than ever, especially in computer science.</p>
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2016-02-02-nsf-crii-reviewer-feedback/write_grants.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Last September, I submitted a proposal in line with <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15569/nsf15569.htm">NSF’s 15-569 program solicitation</a>: the Research Initiation Initiative in Computer and Information Science and Engineering.</p>
<p>Insert jokes involving “initiation initiative” imagery here (sorry, I don’t have an avalanche of Advil).</p>
<p>Somewhat unsurprisingly but nonetheless disappointingly, I received notification today that the proposal was rejected. I say unsurprising because the proposal itself was incredibly rushed; we hit “submit” about two minutes before deadline. It was my first major grant proposal, so there were bound to be some mishaps.</p>
<p>So: let’s get into the reviewer feedback!</p>
<section id="reviewer-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reviewer-1">Reviewer 1</h3>
<p>This was the longest review (aside from the Panel Summary). The reviewer listed the Strengths and Weaknesses of the proposal (which I appreciate). For instance, one of the given strengths:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The proposed work seeks to address these limitations: the innovation of this work is the combination of traditional and nontraditional data sets in a tool for disease forecasting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And weaknesses:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The research plan is lacking detail, which significantly call into question the intellectual merit of the proposal. For example, very little detail is given regarding how the models in Task 1 and 2 will be tested. Eg, how will the team determine that the models are operating at a sufficient level of accuracy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This point is particularly brutal:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It’s unclear how the proposed work will help him differentiate his work from work done previously with graduate advisors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That, more than anything else, is dangerous territory. The first weakness can be described as a consequence of rushed writing. The second is systemic and not trivial to assuage.</p>
<p>Overall, this reviewer gave the proposal a rating of “Fair.”</p>
</section>
<section id="reviewer-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reviewer-2">Reviewer 2</h3>
<p>The feedback here wasn’t quite as structured as Reviewer 1, but still provided a reasonable level of detail.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Strengths are the concept of developing a […] based on […], and […], both in terms of […] and […]. Another strength is the PI’s experience with […], and in using […].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put another way: the reviewer liked the general idea, and the fact that I’ve had a little experience with it in the past.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>However, several major concerns are: 1) as far as I can see, the PI doesn’t have a great deal of experience working with […].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was an excellent point. I mentioned a particular strategy but formally don’t have any training with it. I neglected my own rule of “justify everything” here.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>No clear description of the data mining and statistical methods for error evaluation and estimation of signals from the inevitable noise from […]</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Rookie mistake on my part.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>validation of system predictions underdeveloped, when this would be of major importance</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Also a rookie mistake.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>finally, the choice of […] seems idiosyncratic. The budget is for […]. No involvement of […], which again casts some uncertainty as to successfully developing and implementing the […].</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This ties back with the reviewer’s first criticism: since I don’t have much experience with this certain strategy, the next best thing would be to provide funding for someone who does, which I did not do.</p>
<p>Part of the reviewer’s summary included this line:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It will also be remarkable if all the activities proposed can be achieved within 2 years, especially given that most of the work will presumably be carried out by graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a way, this is something of a relief: my original plan had been to submit a <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15555/nsf15555.htm">CAREER proposal</a> on this topic; if a reviewer thinks the topic is too large-scale to be done in two years, it may be the right scale for a 5-year CAREER award.</p>
<p>Overall, the reviewer gave the proposal a rating of “Fair.”</p>
</section>
<section id="reviewer-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reviewer-3">Reviewer 3</h3>
<p>The third reviewer is something of an outlier, though <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VRBWLpYCPY">not in the usual way</a>.</p>
<p>The feedback was extremely succinct, and universally positive (knee-jerk aside: was this a student?). It was also at a very high level; it never addressed the details of the proposal, only the big-picture ideas. Here’s the summary:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Overall, the proposed research activities have significant potential to be transformative. The two core objectives and corresponding tasks ([…]) seem ambitious to the reviewer. Integration of research and educational activities are relevant and intersect various disciplines (computer sciences, cellular biology, genetics).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well-written, but nonetheless out of sync with the other two reviewers. Don’t get me wrong–I <strong>greatly</strong> appreciate some positive feedback on my first NSF proposal as PI! This reviewer gave the proposal a “Very Good” rating, which is also a nice shot to the ego. But it’s clear there were some glaring weaknesses that, for whatever reason, this reviewer chose not to elucidate.</p>
</section>
<section id="panel-summary" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="panel-summary">Panel Summary</h3>
<p>Nothing surprising here. The strengths from the previous reviewers were identified, along with the numerous accompanying weaknesses. The panel did address the issue of broader impacts:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Although the proposal has merits, the PI may need to clarify clearly as to the major justification for developing the proposed tool in relation to other initiatives in this area, eg […]. The panel also highlighted several problems and questions with regards to […]. Until these problems are addressed, it was felt that the broader impact of this project, particularly the probability of […], is likely to be moderate to low</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That, along with a “Low Competitive” panel recommendation, pretty much sums things up.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>For the vast majority of weaknesses, their immediate impetus can be summed up thusly: <em>I started writing the grant the day before deadline.</em> That’s a no-no, and contributed directly to the panicked flurry at the end and lack of detail in the proposal itself. Starting earlier will solve these problems.</p>
<p>The last point that genuinely concerns me, though, is the first reviewer’s comment on differentiating myself from my graduate advisors. It’s true that this proposal took work I started as a graduate student, and I agree that it’s important to build an independent research group such that I don’t have to rely on my graduate advisors for funding.</p>
<p>But I suppose I could boil this down to time constraints as well: given more elbow room, I could have provided a more detailed development plan that clearly differentiated itself from work done before. Rather than relying on the “we propose to <em>extend</em>…” mantra, I could have delved into much greater detail on the methods I’d wanted to use and why their application would be novel.</p>
<p>So there you have it: a review of grant reviews. Nothing left to do here but incorporate the feedback and push out more effective proposals in the months to come!</p>

  <title>Introductions</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Well, this seems to be working. Kinda.</p>
<p>I took some inspiration from <a href="http://jakevdp.github.io/">Jake VanderPlas’ Pythonic Perambulations</a> and opted for a similar route: Pelican as the backend blogging machine, github as the host, and (eventually) embedded Jupyter notebooks. Unfortunately, Jake’s addition to the Pelican plugins to <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/blob/master/liquid_tags/notebook.py">allow Jupyter notebooks</a> uses CSS that is, shall we say, unfriendly to Pelican themes outside of the Octopress default.</p>
<p>So that part is still incomplete. As are many of the links and some of the plugins. But ultimately, I’m hoping to use this to supplant my current pair of blogs that jointly detail what my plan for this space is: academia, general data science, and other musings.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
