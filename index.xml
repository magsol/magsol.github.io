<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about “agency” this year, and how the lack thereof underlies <em>so much</em> of what I’ve been struggling with the past several years. Arguably it’s been my singular source of burnout, and is my focus for 2025.</p>
<section id="work" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="work">Work</h3>
<p>I realize I haven’t really posted much work stuff here, despite saying I would in previous posts. Work has easily been the single greatest source of stress for me over the past decade, in no small part because it has <em>embodied</em> my lack of agency, starting—frankly—all the way back when I was initially offered the position at UGA.</p>
<p>This past year, I worked as a “Principal AI/ML Scientist” with a small, Pittsburgh-based biotech startup called <a href="https://predxbio.com/">PredxBio</a>. I was officially on sabbatical with UGA, though my intention at the time was to leave UGA entirely sometime during 2024. Unfortunately, 2023-2024 have been extremely rough years for not-FAANG tech companies, startups in particular. Sometime in the summer, the CTO informed me that things were looking bleak funding-wise. So I started laying some other groundwork (I’ll come back to this in a minute).</p>
<p>PredxBio is, professionally, <em>hands-down the most fun I’ve had in the last 10 years</em>. I worked with a small but incredibly talented and dedicated team on both the science and engineering around a niche but fast-growing area called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_biology">spatial biology</a>.” In practice, I helped bring some industry-standard development practices to their existing spatial proteomics pipeline, refactoring some years-old code which led to (I kid you not) a 1000% increase in performance—an operation which took two days was reduced to <em>30 seconds</em>. I also dove into the (very cool) <a href="https://scverse.org/">scverse</a> ecosystem and created the company’s first spatial transcriptomics pipeline. I was in the middle of working on a project for a client that would actually <em>combine</em> the proteomics and transcriptomics pipelines—become truly multiomics—when the year ended. It’s an incredible project, with incredible people, and I’ve been mourning having to leave since November.</p>
<p>Now, enter said groundwork. For most of the summer, I spoke with the unit heads of both the UGA Institute of Bioinformatics (IOB) and Department of Cellular Biology, the latter of which is already one of my home units. I pitched, and was eventually able to land, a change in my “home unit” assignment: rather than being split between Computer Science and Cellular Biology, I will zero out Computer Science and move that affiliation over to IOB. There are <em>a lot</em> of reasons for this, both personal and professional, but it boils down to <em>agency</em>: I wanted to build a role that I could get excited about, where I could pursue computational biology questions that excited me, both in the classroom and the laboratory, while working with colleagues and students who were likewise excited and supportive.</p>
<p>I’ve gotten everything out of Computer Science that I can, and it’s gotten more than its fair share out of me. This is an opportunity of <em>my own making</em>—of course, done in collaboration with people I couldn’t have done it without, and with whom I hope to continue collaborating as fruitfully for years to come. But unlike when I first accepted the CS position over a decade ago, I not only voiced my concerns and requests, but <em>stood by them</em> until we reached a consensus based on mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Even better: I’m planning to continue consulting one day per week with PredxBio (as per my right as faculty), with the plan/hope that, if all goes well financially over the next few months, I’ll return to full-time over the summer. In my dream scenario, I’m also planning to submit an R01 grant that names PredxBio as a chief collaborator; if funded, this would solidify our professional relationship for at least the next five years, and give both of us the financial and logistical flexibility to continue working together. It’d even open up a recruiting avenue if PredxBio needs to start hiring (definitely a longer term plan!), so I’m really crossing my fingers here.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, I’m trying to create something that actually gets me out of bed in the mornings. The perfect antidote to burnout, or at least the next step in healing. Rather than stumbling from one five-alarm fire to the next, I’m trying to be intentional.</p>
<p>Time will tell. But for now, I’m cautiously optimistic.</p>
<p>There is still <em>A LOT</em> I find problematic with academia in general, UGA specifically, and my units in particular. A couple weeks ago I was invited out of the blue to apply for an NIH early career reviewer program, only to have my application desk-rejected after I’d put in a few hours to assemble everything. This past summer, UGA committed the third accounting error in as many years whereby someone up the chain fucked up my financials, but in order to fix it, needed to either nuke my indirect accounts or, in this case, withhold subsequent paychecks to cover the difference (the total amount UGA has fucked me over is now in excess of $130,000, I should add). I just had a conference paper rejected, and the two reviewers’ feedback I received totaled three sentences, all of which were addressed in the paper itself.</p>
<p>These are things I have no control over; raging against them is certainly what I’d like to do, but would ultimately be a waste of time and energy. Like the design of my new role, I need to focus on what I can control in order to create opportunities. So for the time being, I’m keeping one foot in academia.</p>

<section id="running" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="running">Running</h3>
<p>I’ll go into this more on my <a href="https://wherearethepancakes.wordpress.com/">running blog</a>, but since I mentioned it in my <a href="../../posts/2024-01-05-a-year-of-extremes/index.html">2023 retrospective post</a>, I wanted to say here: not only did I hit 1000 miles this year, I piled on another 70 for good measure. I also hit a week of over 30 miles (once, but still), and the Chickamauga Battlefield half marathon for the first time since 2018 (I ran the full marathon in 2019, so it’d been only five years since going to the actual location for a race).</p>
<p>There’s still a lot to do here—I’m still feeling as though long COVID has its claws in me and I’d really like to get some answers; I’m also frustrated with how I don’t feel as though I’ve gotten any faster this year; long runs in particular have been grueling, and I’m not sure if it’s because of the first item or something innocuous (e.g., I need a better fueling strategy)—but I’m proud of the routines and habits I’ve established, and the <em>space</em> I’ve created for running, and I finally feel as though running is truly part of who I am again.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="personal">Personal</h3>
<p>This year was… a lot. I go into it quite a bit in <a href="../../posts/2024-06-13-desolation/index.html">this post from the summer</a>: our 9+ year old bunny Clover dying, my parents’ house being broken into, the multiple bullshit accounting mistakes made by UGA which I had to bail them out of, starting back on SSRIs for the first time in several years, parenting a toddler-turned-young-kid, (inter)national politics. To this day, I cannot say which I find more repugnant: RG progressives who have no Middle East connections but suddenly became Middle East geopolitical experts on Oct 8, 2023, yet have been silent ever since; or TG progressives, likewise with no Middle East connections, who have since made the Middle East their entire personalities.</p>
<p>On that note, I’ve also wrestled with a lot of my own inner demons: one of my goals for 2024 to work on my deep-seated anger and resentment. This entailed coming to terms with prior working situations, re-evaluating relationships, and making a whole lot of decisions about what was important enough to continue to make space for, and what needed to be let go. This was as innocuous as deep cleaning our garage and its 10+ years of accumulated <em>stuff</em> when contractors came to install our solar panels + battery setup: a lot of it we could easily part with, but some had pretty deep sentimental value but was otherwise just taking up space. It was also as complicated as relationships that have changed for reasons unknown, and it’s that unknown part that is the most heartbreaking and makes it so difficult to decide one way or the other whether to keep sticking it out; in the end, we need to do what’s best for us.</p>
<p>My wife’s therapist put it nicely: we’re closing the door, but that doesn’t mean they can’t knock on it sometime later, at which point it’s up to us whether we answer.</p>
<p>I’m also working on a mindset shift, one that understands and embraces the truth that current situations are <em>temporary</em> by definition, and I can decide whether I want to tough it out or go try something else. This is a valuable perspective both personally, but also professionally—it underlies all my efforts to create something that excited me: if things are still miserable, I can try something else. Or leave.</p>
<p>I did set up a Signal group chat following the election, full of <em>absolutely wonderful</em> human beings who have easily been the most consistently bright point in the weeks since<sup>1</sup>. It’s not a large group, just 10 of us (some I haven’t met in person), but we’ve already had some wonderful discussions. It can be more or less summed up by the image I chose as the group avatar. National politics continues to be a shitshow and will likely only get worse over the next four years, but <a href="https://amyjko.medium.com/the-coming-storm-03a03750016b">this mindset shift should help</a>. My therapist has always said to lean into worse-case scenarios, not because they’ll necessarily become true, but because we may discover <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/opinion/editorial/editorial-hope-time-darkness">we’re more resilient than we initially thought</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>I also <a href="../../posts/2024-01-25-the-legend-of-makar/index.html">assembled the single most powerful desktop I’ve ever built</a>, organized the home upstairs office with a server rack, upgraded our home network with a <a href="https://firewalla.com/">Firewalla</a>, and have spent the last month making progress on <a href="../../posts/2024-12-04-december-adventure-2024-edition/index.html">more easily accessible homelab services</a>. We had our nearly-20-year-old roof replaced, had solar panels put on it and backup batteries installed, substantially improved the insulation in our attic space, and are epsilon-away from having a couple of windows replaced to really complete weather-ification.</p>

<section id="plans-for-2025" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="plans-for-2025">Plans for 2025</h3>
<p>I’m still not making “resolutions” in the traditional sense. As <a href="https://mastodon.social/@glyph/113755645565821731">a recent toot made very explicit</a>: “the structure of the exercise is practically designed to set you up for failure” (like some other things of the past few years<sup>2</sup>). As <a href="https://mastodon.social/@grimalkina/113754067707608423">someone I deeply admire</a> put it: “it is always a wonder how much this [time off] ultimately actually leads to things the world sees as productive….when you make that NOT the goal”.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, my biggest priorities this year are to focus on <strong>agency and intentionality</strong>: creating opportunities where I can, and walking away when I need to. I created this “new” role for myself at UGA; now I need to commit to doing everything I can to succeed in it. At the same time, I can always tweak things that aren’t working; alternatively, I can walk away entirely. My situation need not be permanent. Change, or choose.</p>
<p>My other plans, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>1000+ miles running (again), with an emphasis on 100+ mile months, and 30+ mile weeks</li>
<li>Finish cleaning out the garage, and start in earnest on cleaning out the upstairs</li>
<li>Keep cultivating new opportunities through consistency and intentionality</li>
<li>Set and hold boundaries, especially around work/life balance</li>
</ul>
<p>In my <a href="../../posts/2025-01-01-december-adventure-thats-a-wrap/index.html"><code>#DecemberAdventure</code> wrap-up post</a>, I laid out the next steps for getting internal/homelab services up and running with their own DNS entries and SSL certificates. I feel reasonably confident about this approach, thanks to some of the groundwork I did last year and especially during <code>#DecemberAdventure</code>. The first step? Completely reformat my Pi cluster and start over!</p>
<p>Happy 2025, everyone. Much love to all.</p>

  <title>December Adventure: That’s a wrap!</title>

<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2025-01-01-december-adventure-thats-a-wrap/zippy.jpg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Picture of our black cat Zippy sitting in a chair intended for our 4yo, looking like she's the most relaxed any cat has ever been."></p>
<p>Welp.</p>
<p>Don’t know about you, but this December <em>flew</em> by for me. I should have anticipated that, come the week of Christmas, I would have approximately negative time with which to continue <code>#DecemberAdventure</code>. Still, it took me by surprise. So let me try to wrap up where things stand.</p>
<section id="cluster-wide-reverse-proxy" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cluster-wide-reverse-proxy">Cluster-wide reverse proxy</h4>
<p>Even if I haven’t implemented this yet (due to reasons I’ll get to), I think at this point I understand pretty well how to do it. It more or less boils down to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Set my local DNS (i.e., my Firewalla router) to point some version of <code>local.my.domain</code> to my reverse proxy</li>
<li>Create local CNAME entries that point to various local services</li>
<li>Add a <code>*.local.my.domain</code> sans domain in my traefik configuration to get the SSL to work for these endpoints</li>
<li>Set up a kubernetes <code>Service</code> object for each local service I want traefik to be able to access</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s about it! I’m still a little iffy on step 2, mainly because I don’t know what will prevent any device on the network from skipping the top-level (local) domain pointing to the reverse proxy and going straight for the CNAME entry that is actually being requested. But I suppose, at this point, I just need to deploy it and see what happens.</p>
</section>
<section id="cat-magic-deck" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cat-magic-deck">Cat Magic deck</h4>
<p>I haven’t really made any changes to my <a href="https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/04-12-24-cats/">Cat deck</a>—i.e., it’s still mostly a template—but I did receive a nice Amazon gift card for Christmas, so I used it to purchase some of the cards I’m quite sure I’ll need. Hopefully that will help me winnow this thing down to a standard 60-card deck.</p>
</section>
<section id="pi-cluster-next-steps" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pi-cluster-next-steps">Pi cluster next steps</h4>
<p>In doing all this research for the reverse proxy, it became increasingly clear that I need to overhaul the entire cluster—hence the reason why I stopped just short of implementing anything regarding the reverse proxy.</p>
<p>Right now, the cluster has no “local” storage (meaning, no storage connected directly to any of the Pi SBCs); everything instead goes over the network. This works, certainly, but it’s not ideal, particularly when the power goes out or I need to selectively shut things down: I have to be careful in what order I shut down 1) the Pi cluster, 2) the network file storage, and 3) the network hubs connecting everything. It would be <em>substantially</em> easier if I had storage connected directly to the Pi machines that the k3s cluster could use.</p>
<p>So I used some Christmas money to purchase a couple of SSDs. Meaning that I’ve also spent a lot of time looking into <a href="https://longhorn.io/">Longhorn</a> and <a href="https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/">Garage</a> distributed block storage solutions for kubernetes clusters. I have everything ready to go there, but in so doing I need to prepare in case I’m not able to transfer everything over from the current network storage location.</p>
<p>Meaning I need to prepare to more or less start from scratch. Which will, frankly, simplify things. It’ll also give me opportunities to update the k3s clients, the base OSes (from Ubuntu 22 to 24), and the various helm charts (not to mention fixing the namespace issues I enumerated in an <a href="../../posts/2024-12-13-december-adventure-exploring-yaml/index.html">earlier post</a>).</p>
<p>Admittedly it does feel like every personal project ends up with some version of “re-do everything I’ve already done so this one tiny addition will work,” but hey, isn’t that what learning is all about?</p>
</section>
<section id="section" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="section">2025</h4>
<p>I’m working on a 2024 Retrospective post. It’s gonna be a doozy. Hopefully I’ll have it up in the next couple days.</p>

  <title>December Adventure: Oh that’s how DNS works</title>
  <dc:creator>Shannon Quinn</dc:creator>
  <link>https://magsol.github.io/posts/2024-12-20-december-adventure-oh-thats-how-dns-works/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2024-12-20-december-adventure-oh-thats-how-dns-works/snowbun.png" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Picture of our white bunny Clover enjoying a rare snowfall, from back in 2018. She was our little snowshoe hare."></p>
<p>Ok, I’ve been barking up the wrong tree.</p>
<p>The wildcard subdomain I was referencing in my previous post? That’s only needed for <em>certificates</em>, not for actual subdomain resolution. Also, if one can resolve <code>domain.org</code>, then one can also resolve <code>test.subdomain.org</code> (thank you, Firewalla support; keep up the truly remarkable work, y’all). Furthermore, the only role my DNS registrar serves in this process is to validate that I own the root domain; after that, Let’s Encrypt does its thing, and all domain resolution happens within my home network.</p>
<p>I realize this is all probably obvious to everyone (and parts <em>have been</em> obvious to me, at some point previously), but for some reason it’s taken me reading lots of Reddit threads, watching YouTube videos, and contacting customer support to fully connect all these dots. The only <em>actual</em> place the wildcard domain exists (e.g., <code>*.local.domain.org</code>) is in the Traefik configuration under the “sans” header. That’s it! My DNS registrar has my root domain, and my internal DNS server has all the CNAME entries pointing to various services.</p>
<p>Seriously, DNS is so simple, it’s complicated.</p>
<hr>
<p>There’s been a LOT going on this week, as work stuff has wound down and holiday preparations have kicked into very, <em>very</em> high gear. I’ve been feeling a lot of different things—chief among them, sadness that my yearlong sabbatical with PredxBio is almost complete—and so I’ve been pretty distracted this week.</p>
<p>We also disassembled Clover’s old “condo” (the DIY home setup I built ~6 years ago), deep-cleaned the area around it, and had a bulk trash pickup for the spare items. It was more or less the final step to fully <em>seeing</em> that Clover was gone; even though she died back at the end of September, I swear I still saw flashes of white in the corners of my eyes when I glanced past the condo. Now, it’s impossible to refute, and it hurts all over again.</p>
<p>2024 has been such a mixed bag, something I’ll have to write more about later.</p>

<p>I always feel like I have the dumbest questions, mostly because I cannot seem to find answers on the internet.</p>
<p>(either that, or my questions are so SMART, no one’s thought of them; or search engines have gotten SO BAD that they don’t really work anymore… equal odds, I’d say)</p>
<p>In my last post, I’d prototyped a way of reverse proxying a service that runs on a different physical machine than the reverse proxy itself (and which perhaps should be stated explicitly: the service is also NOT part of the kubernetes cluster that the reverse proxy is). However, I couldn’t actually access it… because I didn’t have a DNS entry for said external service. I could reach the reverse proxy, but it didn’t know where to go from there.</p>
<p>Which made me realize a conundrum: how do I actually configure DNS to do this?</p>
<p>I’m trying to set up a subdomain on a domain I already own (quinnwitz.house), except this subdomain is <strong>only accessible from my LAN.</strong> So anytime someone goes to, say, <code>jellyfin.home.quinnwitz.house</code>, it does nothing <em>unless</em> they’re on my home LAN, in which case they’ll go to my local JellyFin instance (and it’ll have an SSL cert).</p>
<p>It’s clear I need to create an A record for a wildcard domain… but it’s <em>not</em> clear 1) where this A record should reside (the base quinnwitz.house domain is on Cloudflare; is that where it should go, too?), and 2) what it should point to.</p>
<p>I did manage to find a single Reddit thread asking pretty much exactly this question: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/17h16g7/cloudflare_dns_pointed_to_internal_ip_address_safe/">is it safe to put a wildcard subdomain on Cloudflare, pointing to an <em>internal</em> IP address</a>? The answer seems to be “yes”, but I can’t help but wonder if this is the “right” way of doing it.</p>
<p>After posting about my last update on Mastodon, I did get a couple of responses (thank you! and yes, <a href="https://doc.traefik.io/traefik-hub/api-management/external-api#create-an-externalname-service">traefik does indeed support <code>externalName</code></a>). But the crux of it all still <em>assumed</em> I had a wildcard A record set up somewhere, when… that is currently not the case, and is indeed the thing from the previous update where I mentioned that I knew what was wrong, but wasn’t sure how to fix it.</p>
<p>If anyone has any ideas, I’d love to hear it.</p>

<p>As an aside, there are some great DNS memes out there. Here are two of my favorites.</p>

  <title>December Adventure: Exploring YAML</title>
  <dc:creator>Shannon Quinn</dc:creator>

Credit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/hwxsgi/ah_yes_mark_yaml/"></p>
<p>Whew, that week went by in a flash. I’ve actually been working on this <code>#DecemberAdventure</code> project these past few days and have made some strides; I just kept running out of time (and inclination) to post about it.</p>
<p>Part of the problem—as an aside—is that I had to close the YAML project space in my VS Code editor in order to <em>open</em> the project space for writing a blog post, which makes it difficult to cross-reference very specific issues and instead relies on “vibes” for writing the post. I’m sure it’s to the detriment of any readers, but I enjoy being as specific as I can. If anyone wants to tell me the magic key combination that allows me to open up multiple project spaces simultaneously in VS Code, please do drop me a line.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hit upon a couple of crucial resources this past week that have helped me make some progress. First, I identified some very specific changes I need to make:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traefik needs to be moved to a <code>traefik</code> namespace</li>
<li>Cert-manager needs to be moved to a <code>cert-manager</code> namespace</li>
<li>Upgrade cert-manager CRDs</li>
<li>Cloudflare API keys need to be moved to <code>cert-manager</code> namespace</li>
</ul>
<p>These are easy enough, only requiring some minor configuration tweaks to the yaml.</p>
<p>But I have <em>a lot</em> of deeper questions about the configuration involved in having Traefik route to external services.</p>
<ul>
<li>A big one: just about all the examples I can find entail doing this, but for Docker-Compose, not kubernetes. Why is that? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1vOfdz5Nm8">Here’s one</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hfejNXqOzA">another one</a>, <a href="https://community.traefik.io/t/external-services-config-yml/24793">another one</a> (I think; it doesn’t actually specify), and <a href="https://community.traefik.io/t/how-to-forward-request-to-external-host/23932">another one</a> (same problem).</li>
<li>I did manage to find a <em>few</em> examples using kubernetes: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4CmbYL9UPg">here’s one</a> (2+ years old), <a href="https://community.traefik.io/t/traefik-k8s-and-an-external-service/6305">another one</a> (4+ years old, bordering on useless), <a href="https://community.traefik.io/t/kubernetes-ingress-to-external-service/20001">another one</a> (the answer is not helpful), <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72484227/traefik-ingress-for-external-service-troubleshooting">another one</a> (also with an unhelpful “answer”), <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/13a2zy2/using_k3s_traefik_installation_to_reverse_proxy/">another one</a> (2+ years old), and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Traefik/comments/16eskh4/external_service_load_balancer_in_kubernetes/">another one</a> (this seems the most promising).</li>
<li>Why is my traefik <code>values.yaml</code> <a href="https://github.com/bplein/post-talos-setup/issues/2#issuecomment-2276603841">so much longer</a> than the <a href="https://github.com/techno-tim/launchpad/blob/master/kubernetes/traefik-cert-manager/traefik/values.yaml">one used in TechnoTim’s video</a>? Specifically, why is his traefik configuration devoid of <code>certResolver</code> and <code>env</code>? Is it because I’ve managed to incorrectly configure how much cluster obtains certificates?</li>
<li>Why isn’t there a domain under his <code>ports</code> section? Is this, again, because I seem to be doing certificates differently?</li>
<li>If I’m setting up both a <code>Service</code> and <code>Ingress</code> for each external server I want to reverse proxy behind traefik, what do I set for their ports? And names? And namespaces?</li>
<li>How do I match namespaces with certificates?</li>
</ul>
<p>But anyway. I tried to take a stab at it anyway, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Traefik/comments/16eskh4/comment/jzyc4vu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">using this</a>:</p>

<p>No HTTPS, just regular ol’ port 80. And it worked… kind of. I got a 404 error.</p>
<p>After thinking about it for a couple minutes, I realized: right now I have my local DNS pointing <code>unraid.my.local.domain</code> to the IP address of the <em>traefik proxy</em>, NOT the actual Unraid server. Which I guess would explain the 404, right?</p>
<p>So then, here’s my biggest question: <strong>if I want to route all internal traffic through this proxy, but need the proxy to check with the external DNS server for the right IP address for the server… howwwww does that happen???</strong></p>

  <title>December Adventure: I have a bad feeling about this</title>

<p>Back from the weekend. In general I suspect weekends will be consistent blank spots in my <code>#DecemberAdventure</code>-ing, as activities and parenting and <em>napping</em> make it challenging to do much else. But who knows!</p>
<p>Anyway, today I eased back into things by doing some research into using Traefik as a reverse proxy for external services. Indeed, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1c0jjde/traefik_but_for_external_use_as_well/">it seems entirely possible</a>, even if that Reddit thread makes <a href="https://xkcd.com/979/">absolutely no mention of the solution</a>.</p>
<p>At this point, I need to figure out a good testing setup. I need a way to get rapid feedback that things are working at each step of the process, rather than flicking the switch at the very end and wondering which of the two dozen steps before it is the one with the problem. Here’s what I’m thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a single external service to start with (e.g., JellyFin—it’s already running)</li>
<li>Design a Service and IngressRoute for JellyFin</li>
<li>Add the JellyFin entry to my Firewalla DNS</li>
<li>Do <em>NOT</em> use SSL, at least initially</li>
</ul>
<p>I figure SSL is going to be its own thing, since I need a wildcard DNS cert from Cloudflare and a whole configuration via cert-manager. So this might be more of a “part 2” once I get the above bullets working. Just proving that Traefik can manage reverse proxy requests for external services will be enough proof of concept to move forward with other parts, like SSL.</p>
<p>I guess I’m just apprehensive, since this will require modifying my current Traefik configuration that successfully serves up my Mastodon instance. Obviously I can always revert configurations if everything breaks, but… well, I hate messing with what already works. But I know it’ll be infinitely more flexible and maintainable going forward if I’m successful.</p>

  <title>December Adventure: Y yaml tho</title>
  <dc:creator>Shannon Quinn</dc:creator>
  <link>https://magsol.github.io/posts/2024-12-06-december-adventure-y-yaml-tho/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2024-12-06-december-adventure-y-yaml-tho/busted_code.png" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="AI-generated image of a Python snake breaking out of a monitor that was previously showing broken Python code."></p>
<p>Today was also a pretty minor update, but what felt like a necessary one to making forward progress (and which reveals just how much of a kubernetes neophyte I am, despite now having a few years’ experience with it).</p>
<p>I successfully created a <code>traefik-values.yaml</code> file of my reverse proxy’s configuration. It’s more or less <a href="https://github.com/bplein/post-talos-setup/issues/2#issuecomment-2276603841">this post</a> from the repo I linked a few days ago. Yeah, that’s the extent of what I got done today.</p>
<p>But it speaks to a much greater problem I’ve been wrestling with for awhile: I set up this cluster two years ago with very little experience or guidance, and have only realized since how unsustainable my deployment is. For example, when installing via helm, I downloaded the <em>full helm charts</em> from the various repositories, then modified only the values I needed to change. Which means whenever changes come down the pipe, either from the org itself or because I need to reconfigure or update something, I need to parse through the hundred-line-plus YAML nonsense to find the exact line I need, rather than—what is apparently the standard practice—having a single YAML file that is essentially a “diff”.</p>
<p>So today was a small, but necessary, step toward making the deployment more sustainable. Also, I added <code>*.local.my.domain</code> to the list of URLs under <code>ports.websecure.tls.domains.sans</code>, which will (hopefully) allow for internal DNS routing <em>and</em> SSL certificates.</p>

  <title>December Adventure: Ajani Goldmane</title>
  <dc:creator>Shannon Quinn</dc:creator>
  <link>https://magsol.github.io/posts/2024-12-05-december-adventure-ajani-goldmane/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2024-12-05-december-adventure-ajani-goldmane/ajani.jpg" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Artist rendition of the MtG planeswalker Ajani Goldmane. https://magic-the-gathring-lore.fandom.com/wiki/Ajani_Goldmane"></p>
<p>Not much of an update today: work was busy, and we’re still putting the house back together after having contractors here for the better part of the last three weeks.</p>
<p>But I was able to review <a href="https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/15-11-24-cats/">this Cats deck</a> and <a href="https://edhrec.com/commanders/arahbo-the-first-fang/cats">this Commander suggestion</a> (courtesy of <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@merlin/113596273800710953">this toot</a>, thank you again!), and to start putting together my own version.</p>
<p>It’s quite rough, but what I have so far can be found <strong><a href="https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/04-12-24-cats/">here</a></strong>. I’ve also gone through all my current MtG cards and pulled out the ones I have (I actually have a Mirror Box!). This process is pretty tedious—it’s one of my (many, lol) personal projects to get a “codex” set up for my collection, and a way of scanning all my cards so they can be automatically added and categorized, but it’s still in the design phase—but it’s done, so now I can start focusing on optimizing the build itself and then determining which cards I still need.</p>
<p>While keeping in mind the whole time that I’m aiming for a single empty spot in the deck for Snowflake to slot in :)</p>
<hr>
<p>Unrelated, but I think I’m just going to refer to the “day” number of December Adventure by the date itself going forward; e.g., today would be “day” 5, not day 2. Starting in the next update, that’s the convention I’ll use. It’s just easier to track it that way and identify which days I missed, than try to keep a running count every time I fire up a new blog post.</p>

<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2024-12-04-december-adventure-2024-edition/decadv.png" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="AI-generated image of a snow-covered pine forest with a pathway of footprints leading into the distance, suggesting an adventure ahead."></p>
<p>Geez but I have a backlog of posts to write. Yeah, I’m back. Been a bit! I’m sorry for the radio silence over here these past nearly-six months; it’s been anything but dull, that’s for sure. While there is plenty of catching-up to do, for now that’ll have to wait: instead, I want to discuss this year’s December Adventure!</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, <a href="https://eli.li/december-adventure">December Adventure</a> is something cooked up as a more DIY alternative to <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>. The spirit is the same—basically, work a little bit each day of December—except instead of following a coding and problem solving script, the goal is entirely up to you. <a href="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2023-12-08-advent-of-adventure/">I took a stab at this last year and was marginally successful</a>, so I figured I’d take another stab at it this year.</p>
<p>Clearly, I’m off to a mediocre start, given that it’s December 4 and I’m only just posting about it now. But I’m hoping by kicking this snowball down the hill, it gives me some momentum. Or maybe I’m just off in fantasy land.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I have a project in mind: creating a LAN-wide reverse proxy for my homelab!</p>
<section id="motivation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>In the past couple years, I’ve really taken to the DIY homelab mentality. In addition to setting up and running <a href="https://quinnwitz.house/">my own Mastodon instance</a> for the past two years, I also set up an Unraid box after converting my old home desktop I built in 2015 (which was still perfectly functional!) to a decently powerful server. With endless news cycles about the death of privacy online, I wanted some corner of the internet to be fully under my own control.</p>
<p>However, between the external-facing Mastodon and a growing number of internal services (JellyFin, <a href="https://github.com/magsol/wildlife-cameras/">wildlife cameras</a>, photo albums, and an eventual <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">NextCloud</a> instance), it’d be really nice—if not outright essential, in the case of NextCloud—to not have to remember IP addresses and ports, and instead just type something like <code>https://jellyfin.local.our-home.domain</code>.</p>
<p>I already have a Traefik reverse proxy running on my 6-node Raspberry Pi k3s cluster, but all it does at the moment is serve up requests for the Mastodon instance (which it is also running). <strong>My goal this December Adventure is to reconfigure this reverse proxy to serve all my internal services</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://community.traefik.io/t/how-to-use-traefik-on-k3s-as-reverse-proxy-for-multiple-lan-services/25149">I even created a thread about this over at the Traefik forums, but it has yet to receive any kind of response</a>. So if you know anything about reverse proxies, feel free to drop a line there!</p>
<p>I’d also started collaborating with a fellow Mastodon user in the Discord over the summer, but he’s since dropped off and I haven’t been able to follow up. <a href="https://github.com/bplein/post-talos-setup">I posted a few issues on his config</a> so we could compare notes, but I’ve yet to hear anything from him, so it seems like I’m on my own.</p>
<p>Everything I’ve heard and seen so far seems to fall into one of two camps: 1. Here’s how to create a reverse proxy on Docker Compose! 2. Here’s how to create a reverse proxy for services that all run on your kubernetes cluster!</p>
<p>What I’m trying to do differs in that I want the reverse proxy to run on my kubernetes (k3s) cluster, but to <em>have it connect to services that may or may not run on the same cluster, and may in fact be running on physically separate machines</em> (the traefik community post has these details).</p>
<p>This would not only make my life easier as the number of internal LAN services grows, but would allow me to get NextCloud up and running (as it <em>requires</em> its own DNS entry).</p>
</section>
<section id="sub-goals" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sub-goals">Sub-goals</h3>
<p>In addition to the main objective of reconfiguring my Traefik instance as a reverse proxy for multiple internal services, there are a few other things I’d like to do.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set up a wildcard DNS certificate for internal services</strong>. This will let me add SSL to everything! I already have Cloudflare as my DNS and certificate provider, so this shouldn’t be too much of a hassle.</li>
<li><strong>Install internal NextCloud</strong>. I’ll probably run this on my Unraid server since NextCloud seems to be a pretty beefy application (i.e., beyond what little Raspberry Pis might be able to handle). I don’t want it to be externally accessible, but it still needs a domain name, hence the dependency on the reverse proxy.</li>
<li><strong>Move kubernetes cluster configuration to a repo</strong>. This is a bit of a meta-goal, as it involves some additional subtasks. But the gist is that my kubernetes configuration is currently a glorified shell script, and that absolutely needs to change. I’ve toyed in the past with putting everything into Ansible, but I think to start I just need to separate out the helm charts for each application and put them under version control so they can be more easily updated and maintained. I already have an internal <a href="https://forgejo.org/">forgejo</a> repository running so I could even just use that, though once again the reverse proxy will dramatically simplify its use.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="other" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="other">Other</h3>
<p>Oh, and I’d also really like to try and build a <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> deck around this card.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2024-12-04-december-adventure-2024-edition/snowflake.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>A really neat unofficial Magic card created by the folks at GamersNexus after their “CEO”, Snowflake: a beautiful orange tabby. And yes, that is nail polish on my thumb; hashtag dad life.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>If you’re interested in computer hardware you should absolutely follow GamersNexus on YouTube. But they’re also just good, decent people. They’re based in North Carolina and recently did a big fundraiser following Hurricane Helene for three of the local charities (including an animal rescue). One of their newest products is a box of gaming dice, and this particular model came with a custom-made Magic (-like) card (because Steve loves D&amp;D and Magic) of his cat Snowflake (the art was done by his mom! so cool!), and now I’m obsessed with building a Cat deck around this card.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/15-11-24-cats/">this promising white-green Cat deck</a> that I might use to start out, but if anyone knows of any other TappedOut / <a href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com/">MtgGoldfish</a> builds along these lines, please send them my way!</p>
<p>Happy December Adventuring!</p>

<p>While in a fugue this afternoon, I dug through the day’s mail and came across the latest biweekly edition of the <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/">National Catholic Reporter</a>, to which I have been a faithful subscriber for years; my wife affectionately calls it my “Jesuit rag.” I paged through it, not really paying much attention to the articles, but I stopped <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/culture/what-bluey-teaches-us-about-times-spiritual-desolation">when I hit this one</a>: “What ‘Bluey’ teaches us about times of spiritual desolation.”</p>
<p>I momentarily shook off my fuzziness and read it. It hit like a punch to the gut (no shortage of those today, for some reason). This paragraph rammed it home:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Desolation, as Ignatian spiritual director and writer Margaret Silf notes, is a spiritual state in which we turn in on ourselves, wallow in negative feelings and find ourselves cut off from community. We lose energy (Bandit spends the whole “TV Shop” episode looking for vitamins to give him an energy boost) and we lose sight of, and interest in, what’s important to us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve always struggled with living in the present and it’s gotten a lot harder in the past decade. Having a kid has made it a mixed bag, though the guilt for realizing I was mentally elsewhere has dramatically increased.</p>
<p>The description for what I’ve been feeling is dead-on: <em>desolation</em>.</p>
<p>I’ve been teetering between professional realities to some extent for almost 3 years now, at times unwilling to commit to a decision, at other times physically incapable. But this year will likely prove definitive, and it’s <em>fucking terrifying</em>. I’ve identified pros and cons, benefits and pitfalls; but there’s <em>so much uncertainty</em> that it becomes this all-encompassing buzz of anxiety that doesn’t quite rise to the level of drowning out everything else, but it’s close. It’s a dull roar with a strong muting effect, exhausting to the point of being very easy to give in until the dull roar is everywhere: a “lights are on but no one’s home” feeling. In a way, committing fully and finally would probably help! And if I’m really honest, I’ve already made a decision—I made it awhile ago—I just haven’t executed on it, not yet.</p>
<p>Somehow, this professional waffling is only one dimension of the desolation that’s been buzzing in my ears.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I heard that while my mom was at home by herself recovering from foot surgery, someone broke into her home. Very fortunately, the intent didn’t seem to be violent; in fact, the person seemed like they were in the middle of a mental health crisis. In some twisted cosmic way, it was almost fortunate that my mom was home, as she is a trained social worker and trauma therapist; the police even commented on how well she’d handled herself. Meanwhile, I can’t help but think about how badly it could have gone; hearing my mom give me the blow-by-blow over the phone when I called her that evening filled me with an awful sense of violation, and a much bigger part of me than I’d like to admit would have preferred that she’d pressed charges.</p>
<p>I received that news via text message while sitting in our vet’s office, listening to the vet tech tell us about the myriad medications we would need to start giving our 9+ year-old senior bunny, Clover (shown in the header photo of this post), to help her stay comfortable as arthritis and other age-related issues takes hold. My wife and I found Clover about half a mile down our street around Memorial Day 2015 during a run together. At the time, we were barely 6 months into our new jobs and location, and we still felt very lost and lonely—finding Clover, getting her taken care of, and welcoming this sweet and sassy bun into our family was one of the few signs that we were where we were meant to be. Finding ourselves nearing the other end is crushing.</p>
<p>After getting home from the vet, I heard that UGA, through some mistake in its software or its processes (they’re always vague about things like this), overpaid me this past month and will be asking for some of the money back. This is the third time in three years that an administrative mistake has resulted in me either having to repay UGA out of my own pocket or never seeing promised money in the first place, and I am… well, I’m <em>fucking furious</em>. I have no recourse, because each of these failures happened somewhere in seventeen layers of bureaucracy, so no individual or group could ever take responsibility. Except for me, of course: since it was my budget mistakenly entered, or my grant mistakenly paid out, or my salary mistakenly given, it’s on me to make the university whole again.</p>
<p>I’m seeing COVID rates start to increase again. Raging antisemitism has a stranglehold with people I once thought were allies and friends. Polls ahead of the November election in the US paint a dire picture of the potential outcome. A longtime and deeply meaningful friendship seems to have changed sometime over the past three years and I don’t know why.</p>
<p>There’s so much noise, so much desolation; all I want to do is turn inward. I know it’s self-defeating—the indecision is paralyzing, which makes any decision completely overwhelming, perpetuating the cycle—but I don’t know how to find that radical acceptance: being completely rooted in the present, for all its faults and uncertainties.</p>
<hr>
<p>I feel an overriding desire to wrap this post up on a positive note but right now I can’t find one, and doing so would be disingenuous. It’d be giving into the desolation by painting a sunnier picture than what actually exists, and in doing so, conveying the subtle but critical message that I don’t need anyone’s help.</p>
<p>Which isn’t true at any level, but holy shit is it difficult to admit: I can’t do this on my own. Even the decision of where my professional life goes from here is not one I can make unilaterally. Maybe some people can; I’m just not one of them. Even if I didn’t have an amazing partner and equal to bounce ideas off of who can see through my every rationalization and weak-ass defense, I’d still seek out the advice of my family, friends, and mentors.</p>
<p>So if there’s any positive ending to this post, I suppose it’s this: I know what I need to do, but I absolutely need help doing it. I can’t beat back the desolation on my own. “We’re all in this together” is something I readily say to everyone—and I mean it!—but I carve out an exception for myself. I’m trying to end that, to reach out when I can tell I’m not only in over my head but am actively digging myself deeper.</p>
<p>Ok, speaking of digging a hole, I lied. <em>This</em> is the positive ending.</p>

<p>We’re at day 23 of <code>#WeblogPoMo2024</code>, and this is post number 7 for me—one every three-ish days, give or take. And in today’s post, I’m here to say: I’m not sure how many more posts there will be. I’m in and out of travel for most of the remaining month, and while there will be plenty of downtime (and, assuming, WiFi access), I’m not expecting joy-writing to be high on the priority list.</p>
<p>Simply put: between jet lag, phoning home, and a really nasty bee sting I picked up that’s taking its sweet time healing—not to mention said travel—I don’t really see much time for this.</p>
<p>I could be wrong! There might be another post, or two, or even THREE (gasp). Anything is possible! But given the stress of travel, I want to temper the expectations of my most important of readers: me.</p>
<p>So in possible lieu of any further <code>#WeblogPoMo2024</code> posts, please enjoy these <em>Homeworld 3</em> screenshots that were actually taken by yours truly.</p>

  <title>#WeblogPoMo2024, Day 16: Python Profiling Rocks</title>
  <dc:creator>Shannon Quinn</dc:creator>
  <link>https://magsol.github.io/posts/2024-05-16-weblogpomo2024-day-16-python-profiling-rocks/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Today I was digging through some code written by somebody else and trying to establish benchmarks against some new data we had just received. In doing so, I noticed the application was spending a <em>lot</em> of time at one particular stage. Upon inquiry, my coworkers said something to the effect of “oh yeah, that part always takes a long time to run.”</p>
<p>In looking through the code in question, some ideas began to form in my head, but I was missing data. So I turned to an old Python friend: <code>cProfile</code>!</p>
<p><code>cProfile</code> is a built-in package—as in, part of the default Python distribution—that performs code profiling and is dead-simple to use. Given that I was interested only in a small slice of the overall program, I did have to dig a bit to understand how to essentially “wrap” a certain part of the program in profiling, so that was new for me.</p>
<p>It basically amounted to:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">import</span> cProfile, pstats</span>
<span id="cb1-2"></span>
<span id="cb1-3">profiler <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span> cProfile.Profile()</span>
<span id="cb1-4">profiler.enable()</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">###</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;"># All the code you want to profile goes here!</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">###</span></span>
<span id="cb1-8">profiler.disable()</span>
<span id="cb1-9">stats <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span> pstats.Stats(profiler)</span>
<span id="cb1-10">stats.dump_stats(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"outputdir/outputfile.stats"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That dumps out the profile information (in a binary format, sorry) to a file. From there, you can spin up something like IPython to read the binary and print out the stats:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1">s <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span> pstats.Stats(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"outputdir/outputfile.stats"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb2-2">s.sort_stats(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"tottime"</span>).print_stats()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then you have all the runtime stats of the code enclosed by your profiler! It even helped me identify a strange <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?O(n%5E2)"> search loop; easy to miss, because it was a 1-liner, but was responsible for <em>over 50%</em> of the observed runtime! I probably would never have found it on my own.</p>

  <title>#WeblogPoMo2024, Day 13: Return to Hiigara</title>
  <dc:creator>Shannon Quinn</dc:creator>
  <link>https://magsol.github.io/posts/2024-05-13-weblogpomo2024-day-13-return-to-hiigara/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ojRQyBqtOg"><em>Homeworld 3</em> went live</a>. I’ve actually been playing the game since Friday, May 10, when backers of its original kickstarter got early access.</p>
<p>I’ve been a fan of <em>Homeworld</em> ever since the first game came out in 1999 to little fanfare, despite garnering a much-coveted “Game of the Year” award for being among the first (or the actual first?) truly 3D real-time strategy games. Of course, that wasn’t its only credit: its beautiful and devastating story of an entire people who suddenly found themselves without a home, its haunting soundtrack (“Adagio for Strings” has always hit me differently, thanks to that game), and graphics that were remarkable for its time.</p>
<p>While I may be among the few who enjoyed the maligned expansion <em>Cataclysm</em> (2000), I very very VERY much loved its sequel, <em>Homeworld 2</em> (2003). Fast forward to the early stages of the pandemic lockdown in 2020 to the release of <em>Homeworld: Remastered</em>, which was among the best “remasters” of classic games (<em>Homeworlds</em> 1 and 2!) I have ever played. This came out around the same time as the <em>Homeworld 3</em> kickstarter announcement, which I eagerly backed.</p>
<p>Of course, at the time, the projected release date was Q4 2022. El oh el. Still, it’s clear from both official reviews and my own experience playing the finished game that the developers used the extra time to really lock down the polish.</p>
<p>As with every previous <em>Homeworld</em> game, it’s gorgeous. Jaw-droppingly beautiful. The soundtrack is, yet again, haunting, complete with modern “Adagio” renditions you can hear if you listen closely. And the story is gripping, always somehow managing to harness the vastness of space and imbue it with malign intent, and the only people you can rely on are your comrades-in-mothership.</p>
<p>I won’t spoil anything, but I will post a few screenshots. These aren’t mine—I took a few from a screenshots channel in the <em>Homeworld</em> Discord—as I haven’t finished the game and know for a fact that some depict missions I have not yet encountered.</p>
<p>It’s a wonderful game. Highly recommend.</p>

  <title>#WeblogPoMo2024, Day 10: Homelab extravaganza</title>
  <dc:creator>Shannon Quinn</dc:creator>
  <link>https://magsol.github.io/posts/2024-05-10-weblogpomo2024-day-10-homelab-extravaganza/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>For today’s <code>#WeblogPomo2024</code>, I wanted to delve a little more into my current Homelab setup, which I’ve only alluded to previously. The <a href="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2023-01-20-mastodon-instance-k3s-rpi-introduction/">series of blog posts I wrote over a year ago detailing my journey setting up a home Mastodon instance</a> was kind of the spark that started this whole homelab kick. I’ve since retrofitted an old desktop (after <a href="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2024-01-25-the-legend-of-makar/">replacing it</a>) as an Unraid server, and have a whole collection of applications already humming along.</p>
<p>My latest efforts have involved getting self-hosted <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a>] up and running… which is highly non-trivial. I’ve wanted off Dropbox for quite awhile now (I don’t use anywhere <em>near</em> the 2TB allocated in the base paid plan, but I definitely use a lot more than the 2GB allowed in the free tier… oh yeah and numerous privacy issues), but getting Nextcloud running has been a whole thing unto itself. It highlighted an entire hierarchy of reconfigurations and upgrades I needed to undertake across the broader homelab to make Nextcloud possible.</p>
<p>It’s also brought to the forefront the biggest philosophical question I’ve had: <strong>do I allow external access to Nextcloud, or restrict it to local requests only?</strong> Nextcloud is arguably designed for the former, but allows for the latter <em>with some non-standard configuration changes</em>. Obviously I’d like to keep external access to any homelab resources to an absolute minimum—if Mastodon is the only thing that’s externally accessible, I’m fine with that. But a filesharing service with an entire ecosystem of applications is not exactly meant to be confined to a small home network. Hence, my waffling.</p>
<p>For now, I’m going down the path of: keep it internal, but look at ways of allowing selective external access, along the lines of the Tailscales and Twingates of the world, both of which are compatible with Unraid. We’ll see.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

  <title>#WeblogPoMo2024, Day 7: The importance of personal projects</title>
  <dc:creator>Shannon Quinn</dc:creator>
  <link>https://magsol.github.io/posts/2024-05-07-weblogpomo2024-day-7-the-importance-of-personal-projects/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I don’t think I’m alone in having a menagerie of personal projects. The constituents of said menagerie morph (some slowly, some quickly) as time passes, but it’s never empty. It hasn’t been empty since… high school? Earlier?</p>
<p>Yes, it’s sometimes disheartening to see how little progress I make on so many different fronts. Though, by simply writing out that sentence, I get just an inkling of how ridiculous it sounds.</p>
<p>But these projects, simply, keep me sane. I love creating things; I love building things; I love trying something out in the real world that is often outside the narrow purview of what my immediate employer is looking for. I like trying things for things’ sakes, though sometimes there is also a practical reason.</p>
<p>Lately I’ve been trying to get a new outdoor wildlife camera setup working. It’s a bit more technically complicated than <a href="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2023-02-15-calibrating-a-wildlife-camera/index.html">the one I posted about last year</a> so it’s taking me a bit longer to get things working. But I’m really enjoying doing it.</p>
<p>Personal projects are, after all, <a href="https://angelostavrow.blog/a-love-letter-to-personal-projects">all about delight</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Like most things, I think when it comes to <code>#WeblogPomo2024</code>, it’ll be a cadence of “when I can” as opposed to “EVERY F#$&amp;ING DAY OR DIAF”. After all, <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/rsingwriting/187070321479/i-saw-a-post-talking-about-how-terry-pratchett">if I’m writing a nontrivial fraction of the number of words Sir Terry Pratchett wrote on a daily basis during his illustrious career</a>, I’d say I’m doing pretty well.</p>

<p>Today, as I was getting back up to speed on work (just in time for the weekend, lol) following travel in the first half of the week, I noticed…something.</p>
<p>Occasionally, my command line would—for lack of a better term—“hitch”.</p>
<p>It became more noticeable as I would type faster; eventually I took to typing gibberish, and it became clear that there definitely was a hitch.</p>
<p>A few minutes of searching (read: tweaking the search parameters, and filtering out “AI”-generated fluff), I found exactly what I was looking for: what is apparently <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/1509474">a known issue with Ubuntu 22.04.4</a>. The fix, aside from upgrading wholesale to 24.04 (not quite ready yet), was a new <code>mutter</code> install.</p>
<p>I installed it and rebooted, and the hitch is gone. Thank you, internet!</p>
<hr>
<p>Yeah, I missed <code>#WeblogPoMo2024</code> yesterday, so I’m already behind. I’ll continue to do the best I can!</p>

<p>It’s been two months (to the day!) since I last posted here. Not a <em>long</em> stretch, relatively speaking, but a respectable one. It’s been a busy couple of months to be sure, but if I’m honest I just haven’t been making time to write anything down. Not for lack of things to write—I feel like I’m always composing blog posts in my head—but working+parenting+running+sleeping typically seems to be a potent enough combination to push out all but the highest priority items that don’t fall in any of those buckets.</p>
<p>Enter <code>#WeblogPoMo2024</code>, something I’d never heard of before seeing <a href="https://social.lol/@hl/112366042124108733">Henry post about it on Mastodon</a>.</p>
<p>Seems challenging while also reasonable: no 2000+ daily word count goal, no minimum running mileage to hit. Just a blog post. I may not finish it (I’d really like to finish an Advent of Code one of these years), but it’d be a nice goal to shoot for. I know from the multitude of early faculty writing workshops I’ve attended that, at least for me, the single most consistent motivator to write is to <strong>write with other people</strong>. The group accountability just <em>works</em> for me. So maybe it’ll work here, too!</p>
<p>Join me, won’t you? Or just bug me until I hit “post”.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>This post contains references to recent events at the University of Georgia involving the deaths of two undergraduate students.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>February was a bruiser of a month: somehow both the shortest of the year by any objective measure, and also the most intense of the past year at least.</p>
<p>For several days this past week I’ve felt that “hollow muscle” sensation that goes beyond mere fatigue. It’s that feeling where you’ve been hopped up on cortisol for days (or longer) at a time and then you finally, blessedly, are able to relax; it feels a lot like a multi-day hangover or even withdrawal. My hands shake, my legs feel wobbly, and on a whole I feel as though I could take a nap at any time.</p>
<p>I’m sure it’s happened to me in the intervening years, but the last time I vividly remember it was right at the start of 2014, as I was entering the final year of my PhD, and I had just started on fluoxetine. It helped me to finally start to sleep through the night on multiple consecutive nights, but I was waking each morning with this same feeling: heavy and tired, sure, but also all my muscles shook, as though coming down from a high. It lasted for at least a week but went away as my sleep and exercise routines evened out.</p>
<p>This past week was one of the worst in recent memory. Somehow, the tragedies of two UGA students dying—one of them <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/23/1233354257/university-of-georgia-death-student">murdered on trails we’ve run millions of times</a>, the other (<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime/uga-student-wyatt-banks-remembered-as-a-friend-to-all-who-loved-to-travel-cook/FUHEEYMEVRA53PSTCXJRGNUUUU/">who died by suicide</a>) a graduate of my high school—were only a part of what made the past week so difficult.</p>
<p>For all the progress I’ve made in learning to cope with and even reverse burnout, I still have no idea how to handle acute situations, especially when it’s multiple in just a few days’ time and the feeling of being hit from all directions is overwhelming. My therapist assured me that, since I didn’t physically or emotionally hurt anyone else or even myself in the immediate aftermath, that alone puts me way ahead of the curve. That helps to hear, but it really doesn’t <em>feel</em> like it.</p>
<p>I’ve had a love-hate relationship with my Garmin Fenix watch ever since purchasing it back in 2015. It has a feature that estimates your current fitness “state”, including categories like “Productive”, “Maintaining”, “Peaking”, or “Recovery.” It measures all of this mostly using heart rate data, which by itself is suspect from a watch; as good as watch-based optical heart rate monitors have gotten, they’re still a “good estimate” at best by comparison to chest straps or pulse monitors at doctor’s offices.</p>
<p>But for the past <em>10 days</em> it’s had me in “Maintaining” or even “Unproductive” for the longest period I can remember, despite making an active push to increase my weekly running mileage. And the reasoning Garmin provided for the classification was pretty damning: it said my activity level was good, but that my fitness was nonetheless still decreasing, a sign that I needed <strong>more recovery time</strong>.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://magsol.github.io/posts/2024-03-01-burnout-marathon/unproductive.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="A screenshot of Garmin's 4-week fitness state summary, which shows the Feb 19-29 period as in either a Maintaining or an Unproductive state, relative to the other 2.5 weeks before it that show mixtures of Productive and Maintaining."></p>
<figcaption>When even Garmin is consistently telling you to calm your shit, maybe it’s time to chill.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I took Monday off from work. I am so, so grateful to have that flexibility to take time when I need it, but wow I needed it. I don’t really remember specifics from the weekend until about Monday evening; that’s how brain-dead I was.</p>
<p>I don’t have any pearls of wisdom for getting through acutely stressful situations; I wish I did. An outlet for both the physical and the emotional/mental energy certainly helps (obviously, outlets that do NOT involve hurting other people). In my case:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pretty intense 30-minute throwing session in my backyard with my pitchback at about 8:30pm. The fact that I escaped without taking a single baseball to the face while the half of the yard I was standing in was in pitch darkness is one minor miracle. That my shoulder wasn’t sore the next day is another.</li>
<li>My wife and I ran together <em>twice</em> this week for the first time since Z was born over three years ago.</li>
<li>I’ve thrown myself into my work this week: I had several very productive work sessions with my colleagues at PredxBio as we continue to build out some new spatial biology models; I wrote some draft SciPy abstracts (we might submit <em>three</em>!); and I approached a potential contractor for one of my grants.</li>
<li>I managed to create a self-sufficient home media server, allowing me to cancel our AppleTV+ subscription a mere 24 hours before it was set to renew for its increased price.</li>
<li>After ignoring the “Focus” mode feature on iOS basically since it appeared, I spent 15 minutes <a href="https://quinnwitz.house/@magsol/111983809170453826">creating a new mode</a> that all but completely disables my phone every night at 8pm. It’s been nothing short of wonderful.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I guess, at least for me: intense physical labor with focused mental applications (winging a baseball and then being forced to field a return; or a high-intensity work schedule that draws on my experience) seems to be my ideal way of coming down from peak activation. I’ve reached out to some friends who have also provided some important feedback—feedback which was obvious in retrospect, but which I was too activated in the moment for it to even occur to me (my therapist had some fascinating insights here about human psychology and our tendency to cling to rules or procedures that make no sense in the moment, but we cling to them anyway because we just want one thing to work the way we expect it to). That back-and-forth with trusted friends also helped to clarify and crystallize my thoughts.</p>
<p>Basically, no quick fix. Certainly no “anti-trigger” on the same intensity and timescale but opposite directionality. Maybe people who can do that exist; I’m certainly not one. But I did learn the hours of the nearby indoor batting cage, and my birthday is coming up, so hopefully I’ll be able to report on that soon. That’s something positive to come out of all this. Small; very small. But positive.</p>
<p>May the memories of the two students be a blessing.</p>

  <title>The Legend of Makar</title>

<p>I built my first desktop from components when I was 15, a sophomore in high school. With the exception of my college workstation (laptops hadnt’t <em>quite</em> reached ubiquity yet), I’ve assembled every desktop I have ever owned since then.</p>
<p>It’s a skill and a pasttime I deeply enjoy, but one which I don’t have the opportunity to explore very often. Even though “every desktop since age 15” sounds impressive, in real numbers it amounts to just a handful:</p>
<ul>
<li>age 15: my family’s home computer</li>
<li>age 19: a server for my dorm room</li>
<li>age 22: my graduate desktop</li>
<li>age 25: the lab’s new workstation during a rotation (not mine, per se)</li>
<li>age 29: my “first real job” home desktop</li>
<li>now: the one in this blog post!</li>
</ul>
<p>There were certainly upgrades throughout that timeline—I swapped hard drives and memory in and out of that dorm server many times; my first “real job” desktop saw at least one GPU upgrade; my graduate desktop was a true exercise in frustration as I spent the first <em>two years</em> diagnosing an <a href="https://magsol.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/one-final-technical-appeal/">intermittent and nigh-irreproducible freezing</a>—but it’s actually rare I get brag to folks that I’m “assembling my new computer from parts.”</p>
<p>So I figured: for this round, I’d go all out with full documentation in the form of a blog post 😁</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<p>The first step in any desktop build: the hardware! I’ve been scoping out the major components off and on for over a year now, using resources like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamersNexus">GamersNexus reviews</a> and <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/">Tom’s Hardware</a> to get a feel for what CPUs / motherboards I should look into.</p>
<p>As an example: I’d spent 11 of the past 12 months with the latest Intel processor locked in, but changed my mind at the [relative] last second when all the head-to-head CPU benchmarks showed the latest AMD Ryzen 9 processors going toe-to-toe with Intel on multithreaded applications (i.e., my work’s bread and butter). That, coupled with AMD’s <em>shocking</em> advantage in power draw and smaller advantage on price made it an immediate no-brainer to switch.</p>
<p>For the curious, here’s the full list of hardware I ended up going with:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU: <a href="https://www.newegg.com/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-ryzen-9-7000-series/p/N82E16819113771?Item=N82E16819113771">AMD Ryzen 9 7950X</a></li>
<li>Cooler: <a href="https://www.newegg.com/deepcool-ak400-zero-dark-plus/p/N82E16835856230?Item=N82E16835856230">DeepCool AK400 Zero Dark Plus 120mm</a></li>
<li>Motherboard: <a href="https://www.newegg.com/msi-mag-x670e-tomahawk-wifi/p/N82E16813144595?Item=N82E16813144595">MSI MAG X670E Tomahawk AM5 ATX</a></li>
<li>Memory: <a href="https://www.newegg.com/g-skill-96gb/p/N82E16820374465?Item=N82E16820374465">G.SKILL Trident Z5 48GB 288-pin PC RAM DDR5 6800 PC5 54400</a> (4x)</li>
<li>GPU: <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/gigabyte-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-gaming-oc-24gb-gddr6x-pci-express-4-0-graphics-card-black/6521518.p">NVIDIA RTX 4090</a></li>
<li>PSU: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B433ZCRP?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details">MEG Ai1300P PCIE 5 1300W</a></li>
<li>Storage: <a href="https://www.newegg.com/samsung-4gb-990-pro/p/N82E16820147878?Item=N82E16820147878">Samsung SSD 990 PRO 2TB M.2 2280</a> (2x)</li>
<li>Case: <a href="https://www.newegg.com/black-fractal-design-torrent-atx-mid-tower/p/N82E16811352143?Item=N82E16811352143">Fractal Design Torrent Black E-ATX Mid Tower</a></li>

</ul>
<p>To address the elephant in the room: no, this build was not cheap, at <em>all</em>. This is all top-of-the-line hardware, meant to 1) last a very long time, and 2) facilitate my kind of intensive number-crunching machine learning work. But I also put it together after having secured an agreement that my sabbatical employer<sup>1</sup> would kick in a small amount, too.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of additional considerations I went through—you’re probably asking, why only M.2 drives? believe me, that was a whole thing, but oddly kinda boiled down to “supply chain problems, lol”—so I’m happy to get into it offline.</p>
<p>But for now, let’s jump into assembly!</p>

<p>Once I had all the components (this was also a Whole Thing<sup>TM</sup>), it took me about 3 days to put everything together. That’s actually a record—the longest it had taken me to assemble a desktop had previous been <em>3 hours</em>. I don’t really know what to chalk that discrepancy up to. Maybe rustiness (it’s been almost a decade since my last full build)? Reverence (I love doing this so much, I want to soak it up)? Nerves (first time building an AMD machine since the dorm room server)?</p>
<p>General fatigue?<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>I started with the case. It came highly recommended through Gamers Nexus, especially for custom cooling. I’ve always dreamed of a fully water-cooled rig, but as the time to finalize the build crept closer, I decided to stick with a traditional air-cooled setup. This case was great in that it lets me do either but defaults to an excellent air-cooled configuration.</p>

<p>Next were all the internal components. Since the case is really just a vehicle for the motherboard, which is really just a vehicle for <em>everything else</em>, I wanted to work my way from the inside out. Especially given the downright titanic proportions of the 4090, I wanted to assemble the motherboard as much as possible before slotting it into the case and losing a lot of physical wiggle room and visibility.</p>

<p>The CPU and associated cooler were first. These were, thankfully, pretty straightforward. The only difference here from my prior experience with Intel was that AMD doesn’t seem to ship its CPUs with stock coolers; hence, I needed to get a custom one. Otherwise, everything slotted in exactly as I remembered.</p>

<p>Next up: memory (or RAM). I was originally going with just a single 2-pack of 48GB DIMMs for a total of 96GB, but my sabbatical employer insisted I max out the memory so I can work with 100+GB single images they have from clients.</p>
<p>That entailed a bit more research on my part on AMD-compatible motherboards to learn what their RAM limits were. I found one with 192GB as its upper limit: hence that motherboard, and hence why I have so much RAM!</p>
<p>I think I enjoy installing RAM the most: there are no moving parts, other than the clips on the motherboard itself that very helpfully “click” when you have properly seated the memory. It’s very satisfying.</p>

<p>At this point, I <em>should have</em> installed the storage devices. But for reasons lost to the passage of time, I didn’t. Instead, I installed the motherboard into the case.</p>
<p>Part of my rationale, I think, was that I knew I couldn’t install the GPU until the motherboard was seated in the case; the GPU was just too big to be installed without the support of the case itself. I also knew some of the M.2 slots were <em>under</em> the GPU; this created some uncertainty about whether the GPU would actually sit correctly if an M.2 device was installed directly under it. My priority here was the GPU—it was so large, it could only fit in one of two slots, and of those two only one was honestly preferable—and to seat the GPU, I needed to install the motherboard into the case.</p>
<p>All in all, motherboard installation is pretty easy: just put the motherboard in the case and carefully screw it down. If the screw holes in the motherboard don’t align with the struts in the case, then something has gone horribly wrong and you should stop.</p>

<p>For one final diversion before the monstrosity that is the GPU, I installed the PSU, aka the power supply. Given that wholly <em>half</em> the power supply’s capacity is going to the GPU, I knew I needed something relatively beefy, hence the 1300W monster PSU. But I also knew I wouldn’t have very many other components that needed direct power.</p>
<p>So a <em>modular</em> PSU was key: one with lots of outlets for potential devices, but whose cords could be disconnected and removed when not needed so as not to clog up the inside of the case with unplugged power cables.</p>
<p>Another reason I love this case is because, at a time when most cases now put the PSU somewhere in the bottom, this case puts the PSU at the <em>top</em>, and even “slightly outside” the case itself! There’s a panel that pops off where the PSU sits, and the cables are then snaked through an opening to the rest of the case for added compartmentalization. It’s quite nice.</p>

<p>Alright. Couldn’t ignore the <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/m85BXZ">Demon King in the Depths</a> any longer. Time to install the GPU.</p>
<p>I knew this thing would be huge going in, but I was still shocked, and I say this as a still-owner of a venerable 1080 Ti. This thing spans the volume of nearly 3x 1080s. It’s absolutely insane. And yet, still <em>technically</em> only takes the space of 2 PCI devices.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, I made absolutely certain before purchasing that all the measurements fit what I had to work with. For a component that was almost half the entire monetary AND eletrical budgets of this build, this was the one I wanted to get right the first time.</p>
<p>Actual installation was a snap, as it has been ever since the advent of separate GPUs. But it seriously felt like plugging an Apollo command module into a 120V home garage outlet.</p>

<p>Whew.</p>
<p>The penultimate hardware step was the two M.2 SSDs. These are the latest in long-term flash storage (NVMe drives) that plug <em>directly</em> into the motherboard for absolutely insane transfer speeds. They’re ideal for—you guessed it—data-intensive computing.</p>
<p>But their positioning wasn’t ideal: two of the motherboard’s four slots were directly under the GPU, and I wasn’t certain the GPU would fit properly if I installed an M.2 under it.</p>
<p>The short version is: the GPU actually fit just fine, but the M.2s themselves didn’t play nice with the arrangement of the motherboard’s southbridge. Fortunately I found a configuration that worked, but this part took a ton of swearing and <em>over an hour</em> of trial-and-error before I finally got everything seated.</p>
<p>The next hard drive will be a standard 2.5” SSD, mmk thx bai.</p>

<p>The last bit of the hardware was to wire everything up! In particular: the motherboard, CPU cooler, case fans, and GPU all needed to be connected directly to the PSU for power.</p>
<p>This is always, in my opinion, the most tedious part of any build. Snaking wires throughout the inside of the case always results in snarls and makes any future work (fixing problems, upgrading hardware) tricky at best. Many cases in the last decade have “cable management” pathways built-in to help with this, but it still comes down to the human to make it happen. And it’s annoying at best.</p>
<p>In this case, I did… ok. Well enough.</p>

<p>We’ve got our build! And she’s gorgeous 😍</p>
<p>Now, the moment of truth: booting up and installing an operating system. Or, in this case, two: I wanted to install Ubuntu (22.04 at time of post) on one of the M.2s, and Windows (11) on the other.</p>
<p>I started with Ubuntu.</p>
<p>I don’t know about other linux distributions—I’ve been on the Ubuntu train ever since Red Hat went corporate, and frankly haven’t had a reason to look back or sideways—but Ubuntu has always been relatively straightforward when it comes to install:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a boot disk (usually a USB disk).</li>
<li>Boot off the disk</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 2 is always the tricky part, especially on a new build: I never know which function key brings up the boot order 🥴 (spoiler alert: it’s F11)</p>
<p>Once I hit the right sequence of keys, the rest of the process was pretty much point and click. Boom! I had Ubuntu installed!</p>

<p>Next up: Windows.</p>
<p>Getting Windows 11 installed, relative to Ubuntu, was a <em>giant pain</em>. In the intervening years, Mircrosoft seems to have gone the route of “install now, license later”—which, honestly, I appreciate—and has provided multiple pathways for creating an installer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, only one of those pathways seems to <em>actually work</em>. I initially went the ISO route, since that’s pretty much equivalent to how I installed Ubuntu.</p>
<p>But that didn’t work. And, weirdly, the internet doesn’t seem to know why. The best hint I found came from <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/no-device-drivers-were-found-tried-everything-w11/a53aa16b-5d4c-4f8a-abc6-e5106152a220">this forum post</a>, which seems to suggest that AMD-specific drivers <em>aren’t included</em> in the ISO installer, thereby making install via ISO on an AMD system… well, impossible.</p>
<p>There were no details on this “include AMD drivers during the install” procedure, and by this point I’d run out of patience (I’d tried multiple sub-pathways, even and including installing Windows <em>10</em> instead; all the same result).</p>
<p>So I went with the one procedure the internet seemed to agree would always work: “get a friend with a Windows PC and run the media installer that only works on Windows.” Yes this is an actual piece of advice on an actual Microsoft forum. Since the media installer option <em>only</em> runs on Windows, you’re in this weird Twilight Zone of needing a Windows computer in order to install Windows on a computer.</p>
<p>Mmk.</p>
<p>This worked, finally. Of course, that was just the warm-up; the install process itself is “<a href="https://exple.tive.org/blarg/2023/12/07/polished-glass/">a disaster from stem to stern</a>.” Thankfully, following that guide helped to minimize the worst of the creeping Windows enshittification. A few important points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Definitely <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/all/set-up-windows-11-without-internet-oobebypassnro/4fc44554-b416-4ecb-8961-6f79fd55ae0f">create a local account</a>. It requires <em>pulling out your ethernet cable</em> and running a shell command, but it’s reasonably straightforward.</li>
<li>For my US readers: you may also want to select “Global English” rather than “US English” in the language selection step, as this apparently eliminates some awfulness in the start-up screen.</li>
<li>The guide mentions widgets in the traditional “Start” button location. That was the case for me too, but I don’t think I actually flipped any “Personalization” switches before realizing the Start menu was back where it should be. Not sure what I did, but at least initially that was definitely the case for me, so watch out.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, we picked up a Windows license and a couple Office licenses from a friend of the family for some steep discounts (that was awfully nice), so I could unlock the power of this <a href="https://i.makeagif.com/media/10-03-2016/hfPN-9.gif">fully armed and operational</a> Windows 11.</p>
</section>
<section id="whats-next" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>
<p>That’s about it—a complete build from components, up to installing two operating systems. So what’s next?</p>
<p>Well, the first thing was to give it a name! I struggled with this for a bit. On one hand, I’d only just finished <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> in late December (yeah, I intentionally sandbagged, savoring the final stages). But on the other hand, most of the devices in my house already have <em>Zelda</em>-themed names.</p>
<p>(Devices that have a <em>Zelda</em>-themed name: 1 of 2 laptops, 2 of 2 smartphones, 1 of 2 iPads, 7 of 8 Raspberry Pis, 1 NAS, and now 1 desktop. WOW, y’all.)</p>
<p>But! In a conversation over Mastodon, I was reminded that this isn’t really a bad thing.</p>
<p></p><div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"> <iframe src="https://fosstodon.org/@jni/111730083884821265/embed" class="mastodon-embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0;" width="100%" height="400" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><script src="https://mastodon.social/embed.js" async="async"></script></div> <p></p>
<p>So I took the first name that came to mind that seemed incredibly appropriate: <a href="https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Makar">Makar, the ancient Sage of Wind</a>.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>Makar, in his element.</figcaption>

</div>
<p>From there, it’s been a matter of configuring two full-blown operating systems. Ubuntu is pretty much the workhorse: that’s where I’ll make heavy use of the GPU. I’ve already installed all the CUDA dependencies and a Python environment with the basic setup, and thanks to the M.2 drives I have plenty of speedy storage for large datasets. On the Windows side, this is indeed for gaming, but also for office productivity (especially if I don’t have my laptop handy). Most of these basics are in place, but it’ll be an ongoing process.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have some n@zis to mow down in <em>Wolfenstein</em> and some segmentation models to run on spatial omics data. Until next time!</p>

<p>Where 2022 tried its hardest to kill me, 2023 merely put that killer instinct in neutral. A vast improvement to be sure, but it requires substantial context to fully appreciate.</p>
<p>Ok, maybe that’s not fair to 2023. It had some highs. It also had some lows. All told, 2023 was one of the most bimodal years in my recent memory, perhaps second only to 2020.</p>
<section id="the-good" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-good">The Good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Running (and health + fitness in general) was <em>huge</em> for both me and my wife in 2023. We both set annual running mileage records<sup>1</sup> that outpaced the last couple years by massive margins.</li>
<li>Burnout recovery was tangible. The difference is night and day. Even though I still have a long way to go, I can get through most typical weeks—even the occasional atypically strenuous week—without needing to aggressively power down.</li>
<li>Related to the previous point, I set and held some boundaries, especially around work.</li>
<li>I snagged myself a pretty sweet gig with <a href="https://predxbio.com/">PredxBio</a> as their Principal AI/ML Scientist, starting January 2024. It’s technically a sabbatical (I’ll post about this later in more detail), but I’m really excited for the change.</li>
<li>I’ve picked up a few at-home side projects that I’m really enjoying. This culminated in a <code>#DecemberAdventure</code> over on Mastodon that saw a lot of tinkering around building out a homelab. It’s still in the proof-of-concept stages but I’m really having fun with it!</li>
<li>My wife and I downloaded, played through, and beat <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. It was pretty much <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wxU3z9VxOY">the opposite of this, but just as beautiful</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I cannot underscore enough how groundbreaking it was for us to find a stride<sup>2</sup> with our running and general activity levels.</p>

<p>My own health improved dramatically over the course of the year (especially after being kicked while down by getting COVID on the evening of December 31, 2022): not only did my labs empirically show this improvement at my end-of-year physical, but my two half marathons this year were separated by 6 months (April and October) and by <em>20 minutes</em> (<a href="https://track.rtrt.me/e/DMP-SAVWHALF-2023#/tracker/RW4KTAP2">2:31</a> in April, <a href="https://results.raceroster.com/v2/en-US/results/cbqshhkjvt39snge/detail/egpe264973f6ynms">2:12</a> in October). Both still technically rank among my slowest half marathon finishing times, but the trend is so, so encouraging.</p>
<p>My burnout has also improved dramatically. Where I could barely make it through a work week in 2022, this past year—through careful planning, tracking of my activity and burnout levels, and changing course as needed—I could maintain relatively normal levels of work intensity, while still protecting time for things I needed and wanted (workouts, hobbies, socializing, sleeping).</p>
<p>Part of this burnout management culminated in seeking out an opportunity with PredxBio, a Pittsburgh-based startup in spatial biology. I started with them just this past Tuesday, and I’m thrilled to see where this change of pace takes me.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-bad" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Despite my burnout recovery, I still had some weeks that fried me so badly I needed to clear my schedule to power down. Not often, but more than zero.</li>
<li>I can’t recall a time when I’ve muted, unfollowed, or blocked more people than after October 7. The sudden influx of middle east geopolitical “expertise” was unreal.</li>
<li>My frustration levels with professionals and their uncritical embrace of hype around AI are high. I’ll be the first to admit: AI does cool stuff, but putting everything else aside to build AI into our workflows without acknowledging its real, myriad weaknesses is really disheartening.</li>
</ul>
<p>I submitted a large grant application in late September, and three days later submitted a smaller seed grant application. This was one example of a week where I pushed myself too hard and needed an acute and immediate recovery period. Another example was mid-November: I was in charge of organizing and MCing a panel on “AI in Higher Education” at my department’s annual “Research Day”, and it just happened to coincide with several instructional milestones that same week. In both cases, I needed to clear my schedule for a couple days. I’m fortunate to be able to do that, but I was also completely non-functional those days.</p>
<p>Speaking of the seed grant: I heard back only weeks ago that our application was denied. Certainly not an unlikely outcome, but what really frustrated me was the following:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Due to the volume of proposals, reviewers were not asked to prepare written critiques.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of my biggest critiques of the academic system on a whole<sup>3</sup>: feedback either isn’t given, or it’s given too late to use, or—at its most destructive—it’s actively misleading.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-ugly" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>We started the year with COVID. I got the “long” version.</li>
<li>While burnout recovery has improved my overall bandwidth, it’s made room for long-simmering and unresolved resentment, frustration, and anger around a variety of things. This needlessly consumed a lot of spare cycles and left me run down.</li>
<li>Everything happening in the middle east since early October.</li>
<li>Nihilism crept in this year. <a href="https://infosec.town/notes/9nx5yvs2am7mdbcs">This toot</a> helped point it out to me, but charting a path out is proving difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>After almost three years of avoiding COVID, my wife and I caught it just before leaving a holiday family reunion in Arizona (though didn’t show symptoms until days after returning home). Our infections were both relatively “minor”—the medical term, though I had a fever hovering just below 102F and she had the worst congestion of her life—but even after I tested negative (it took me almost two weeks to fully clear it), I developed new and lingering respiratory symptoms I’d never had previously. These symptoms lasted for months, nearly into the summer, and included exercise-induced asthma: I would start every run feeling like I was drowning. For the first 20 minutes of a run, my lungs wouldn’t open; I’d feel like I had an elephant sitting on my chest. Eventually my lungs would open, but I’d often be exhausted by that point, making my return to running <a href="https://wherearethepancakes.wordpress.com/2023/10/05/return-of-the-100-mile-month/">very slow and very frustrating</a>. Even now, a year later, I still deal with occasional symptoms, though they have thankfully substantially decreased in intensity and frequency.</p>
<p>I’ve also noticed that my brain has spent a lot more time (and energy) spinning on people who and events that have left me angry or otherwise upset. This has always been a weakness of mine and a regular point of discussion and focused work with my therapists over the years, but in 2023 it got a lot worse.</p>
<p>Resentment was a big problem, especially since I’ve no way of knowing whether the resentment came from something real or because <a href="https://theness.com/neurologicablog/conspiracy-thinking-and-pattern-recognition/">my brain connected disparate events in a way that was completely fictitious</a>.</p>
<p>Combined with real-world events, an impending US Presidential elections with massive implications, and ongoing ambivalence or outright antipathy toward any kind of COVID countermeasures (<a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_new-admissions-rate-county">despite the current wave that is second only to the massive Omicron wave of late 2021</a>), real nihilism crept in. What kind of world am I raising our daughter in? What kind of world am I handing off to her? What can I possibly do to change any of this? <a href="https://amyjko.medium.com/things-i-hope-for-in-2024-8688c4fbd959">Reading Amy Ko’s hopes for 2024</a> helped, as did the numerous reminders to “think global, act local”.</p>
</section>
<section id="plans-for-2024" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="plans-for-2024">Plans for 2024</h3>
<p>I gave up on resolutions years ago, but I still set goals and make plans for achieving those goals. I also try to prioritize and set my goals up for success.</p>
<p><strong>My biggest priority this year, I think, is to tackle the lingering resentment and default-to-anger</strong>. It drained me so needlessly last year, and there’s never going to be any shortage of things and people to be outraged about / at. I’ve seen a lot of memes with pithy reframings, and while I think those are valuable, they don’t quite hit the mark for me; “consider if a person is worth your anger” still feels too antagonistic, too “me-vs-them.”</p>
<p>Instead—and in line with what we teach our daughter!—I want to allow myself space to feel and observe these reactions, and then to inspect and interrogate them. This not only refocuses on me outside of a combative context, but also forges new neural pathways to make this process second-nature.</p>
<p>My other plans, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>1000+ miles running (will probably write about this on my running blog soon-ish)</li>
<li>Reorganize my upstairs office, complete with a home server rack to consolidate hardware</li>
<li>Donate donate donate! (there is SO MUCH STUFF around the house we just don’t use)</li>
<li>Set and hold boundaries, especially around work, but also around family and friends</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other smaller items in there too—I’ve learned a lot more about kubernetes networking and foresee an overhaul of my cluster configuration in the near future; I’m also toying with some yard improvement ideas to try and improve the drainage; and I cannot underscore how much I want to clear out the garage, since it’s about 1/3 full of stuff we literally never touch and most likely never will again—but those are on more of a “as time and energy allow” basis.</p>
<p>I wish everyone a wonderful 2024.</p>
